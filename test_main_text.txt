on 22.04.2014.


      5.    Initially, though the notice was duly served on the

has filed the written statement.


      8.      The Respondent No.2 inter-alia denying the entire case
of the Petitioners in M.V.C.No.1097/2014, has further contended
as follows;


      a)      The petition is not maintainable either on facts or in
law against him.


      b)      He      has      issued      a      Policy      bearing
No.23112001877331011000 in respect of Maruthi Swift Dzire Car
bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9823 and the said policy was in
force from 28.01.2013 to 27.01.2014. Without prejudice to the
confirmation of the policy, the liability of it, if any, will be
subjected to the terms and conditions of the policy, verification of
Engine and Chassis Number, the validity and the effective driving
licence of the rider of the vehicle and subjected to the provisions of
the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_2">M.V. Act</a>.


      c)      He seeks protection under the <a href="/doc/87183818/" id="a_3">Section 147</a> and <a href="/doc/14430771/" id="a_4">149</a> of
the M.V. Act, 1998.


      d)      As per <a href="/doc/734786/" id="a_5">Section 134(c)</a> of the M.V. Act, 1998, it is
mandatory duty of the insured/Respondent No.1, to furnish the
particulars of policy, RC, DL and FC, but, the insured/Respondent
No.1 has not complied with statutory demand. Hence, he is not
liable to pay compensation.
 SCCH-7                         10                 MVC.No.1095/2014




     e)    The driver was driving the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car
bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9823, without possessing a
valid and effective driving licence on the date of the alleged
accident. Hence, as there was breach of condition, He is not liable
to indemnify of the Respondent No.1.


     f)    As per <a href="/doc/74970700/" id="a_6">Section 158(6)</a> of M.V. Act, 1988, it is
mandatory duty of the concerned Police Station to forward all the
relevant documents to the concerned Insurer within 30 days from
the date of the information. But, the Thalaghattapura Police
Station Authorities have failed to forward the documents and not
complied with the statutory demand.


     g)    The Petitioners claimed interest at the rate of 12%,
which is highly excessive and the same is contrary to <a href="/doc/196386/" id="a_7">Section 3</a> of
the Interest Act, 1978 and the observation of the various
Judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court.


     h)    The Petitioners are not entitled to claim any interest on
non-pecuniary damages as per the observations of Judgment of
Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court.


     i)    The deceased&#x27;s driver drove the Car on the road in a
negligent manner without taking proper precautions and without
observing the movement of the vehicles. The accident occurred
during the evening at around 4-10 p.m. The deceased&#x27;s driver
without having proper conscious, along with the four other
inmates had consumed alcohol, i.e., &#x27;Drink and Drive&#x27; as per the
 SCCH-7                           11                MVC.No.1095/2014




Postmortem and FSL Report, the driver himself hit the said BMTC
Bus while driving on the road. The deceased driver in having
taken the risk while having consumed alcohol and driving on the
road in a haphazard manner being the evening hours without
taking proper precautions, without noticing the oncoming vehicles
and as such, the Petitioners are not entitled to any compensation
from him.


      j)      He craves leave of this Hon&#x27;ble Court to take all
defences available to it, under <a href="/doc/184045376/" id="a_8">Section 170</a> of M.V. Act and contest
the case on all grounds, apart from those specified under <a href="/doc/152999974/" id="a_9">Section
149(2)</a> of the Act.


      k)      He craves the leave of this Hon&#x27;ble Court to file an
additional counter at a later stage as and when the better
particulars come to his knowledge.


      l)      Without prejudice to the said contentions, the amount
of Rupees 40,00,000/- with interest and costs claimed by the
Petitioners in the petition is more excessive, exorbitant and
exaggerated and the Petitioners are not entitled for the same from
him. Hence, prayed to dismiss the petition with costs, else, his
Company will be put to irreparable loss and injury.


      9.      The Respondent No.4 inter-alia denying the entire case
of the Petitioners in M.V.C.No.1097/2014, has further contended
as follows;
 SCCH-7                            12                 MVC.No.1095/2014




      a)    At the out-set, the very petition is misconceived and
not maintainable either in law or on facts.


      b)    The BMTC Bus bearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-
1241 on 14.09.2013 was in its schedule trip from Banashankari
to Kempaiahnapalya in Route No.213D/1. When the Bus was
proceeding, in a road in front of Somanahally KEB, slowly,
cautiously by following all the traffic rules in extreme left side of
the road (mud road adjacent to the Tar road), the driver of the
Swift Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825 came in a
opposite   direction   in   a   rash   and   negligent   manner    with
intoxication of alcohol along with other inmates of the Car, those
were also under the intoxication of alcohol and all of a sudden
deviated to extreme right (wrong direction) and dashed as against
the BMTC Bus with great force at left side of the Bus and caused
the accident. In this process, the driver of the Car exposed to that
angle and caused the accident. If the driver of the Car had taken
little care while driving the Car, the alleged accident could have
been avoided. Under those circumstances, he is not at all
responsible for the alleged accident nor his driver and at any rate,
he is not liable to pay any compensation, much less, the huge
amount claimed in the petition vicariously or otherwise as alleged
in the petition.


      c)    The compensation claimed Rupees 40,00,000/- for the
death of deceased is highly excessive, exorbitant, imaginary,
unaffordable and astromical and have no relation to facts and
circumstances of the case. He is not liable to pay the same as
 SCCH-7                              13                        MVC.No.1095/2014




claimed under the facts and circumstances of the case, that too,
when actually the driver of the Car exposed for the accident by his
own negligent and careless attitude.


     d)     The averments made in Column 22 by way of
additional and other information has been used by the Petitioners
for the purpose of concocting false and unbelievable story for the
purpose of somehow extracting a huge compensation from him for
the alleged accident, for which, neither BMTC Bus not his driver
in no way responsible, connected or concerned and they are not at
all responsible for the accident.


     e)     The averments made with an oblique motive by the
Petitioners in order to extract huge sum by way of compensation,
when actually he or his driver was not at all responsible for the
accident.


     f)     He    reserves   his    right       to   file   additional   Written
Statement, if the occasion demands at later date or stage. Hence,
prayed to dismiss the petition with exemplary cost.


     10.    The     Petitioners          No.1        and     2    have      filed
M.V.C.No.1095/2014 as against the Respondents No.1 to 4 under
<a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_10">Section 166</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1989, praying to award
compensation of Rupees 40,00,000/- with costs, in respect of
death of Sri. Mohammed Junaid S/o. Mohammed Syeed.

     e)    The driver was driving the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car

     i)     The deceased driver drove the Car on the road in a

      l)      Without prejudice to the said contentions, the amount
of Rupees 40,00,000/- with interest and costs claimed by the
Petitioners in the petition is more excessive, exorbitant and
exaggerated and the Petitioners are not entitled for the same from
him. Hence, prayed to dismiss the petition with costs, else, his
Company will be put to irreparable loss and injury.


      17.     The Respondent No.4 inter-alia denying the entire case
of the Petitioners in M.V.C.No.1095/2014, has further contended
as follows;


      a)      At the out-set, the very petition is misconceived and
not maintainable either in law or on facts.


      b)      The BMTC Bus bearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-
1241 on 14.09.2013 was in its schedule trip from Banashankari
to Kempaiahnapalya in Route No.213D/1. When the Bus was
proceeding, in a road in front of Somanahally KEB, slowly,
cautiously by following all the traffic rules in extreme left side of
the road (mud road adjacent to the Tar road), the driver of the
Swift Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825 came in a
opposite      direction   in   a   rash   and   negligent   manner    with
intoxication of alcohol along with other inmates of the Car, those
were also under the intoxication of alcohol and all of a sudden
deviated to extreme right (wrong direction) and dashed as against
the BMTC Bus with great force at left side of the Bus and caused
the accident. In this process, the driver of the Car exposed to that
angle and caused the accident. If the driver of the Car had taken
 SCCH-7                              20            MVC.No.1095/2014




little care while driving the Car, the alleged accident could have
been avoided. Under those circumstances, he is not at all
responsible for the alleged accident nor his driver and at any rate,
he is not liable to pay any compensation, much less, the huge
amount claimed in the petition vicariously or otherwise as alleged
in the petition.


      c)    The compensation claimed Rupees 40,00,000/- for the
death of deceased is highly excessive, exorbitant, imaginary,
unaffordable and astromical and have no relation to facts and
circumstances of the case. He is not liable to pay the same as
claimed under the facts and circumstances of the case, that too,
when actually the driver of the Car exposed for the accident by his
own negligent and careless attitude.


      d)    The averments made in Column 22 by way of
additional and other information has been used by the Petitioners
for the purpose of concocting false and unbelievable story for the
purpose of somehow extracting a huge compensation from him for
the alleged accident, for which, neither BMTC Bus not his driver
in no way responsible, connected or concerned and they are not at
all responsible for the accident.


      e)    The averments made with an oblique motive by the
Petitioners in order to extract huge sum by way of compensation,
when actually he or his driver was not at all responsible for the
accident.

     f)    He    reserves   his   right       to   file   additional   Written
Statement, if the occasion demands at later date or stage. Hence,
prayed to dismiss the petition with exemplary cost.

to avoid the confliction in identifying the said marked documents,
Ex.R.1 True copy of FSL Report dated 30.01.2014, which is
marked through R.W.1, is considered as Ex.R.2 in the following
discussion.


     29.      Heard the arguments.


     30.      In support of the submission, the Learned Counsel
appearing for the Petitioners Sri. Rahamathulla Kothwal has
placed reliance upon the decision reported in,


     Civil Appeal No.8612 of 2013 Supreme Court of India (M.
Mansoor and Another V/s. United India Insurance Company
Ltd., and Another), wherein, it is observed that,


                    17. Appellants produced the salary
               certificate of deceased Amjath Khan Arabu,
               which has been marked as Ex.P.8. It shows
               that, the deceased was earning Rupees
               18,100/- per month. The Tribunal has
               rightly taken into consideration the
               aforesaid income for computing the
               compensation. The annual income comes to
               Rupees 2,17,200/-. If 50% of the said
               income is deducted towards personal and
               living expenses of the deceased the
               contribution to the family will be Rupees
               1,08,600/-. At the time of accident, the
               deceased Amjath Khan Arabu was a
               bachelor about 24 years old hence on the
               basis of the decision in Sarla Verma Case
               (supra) applying the multiplier of 18, the
               amount will come to Rupees 19,54,800/-.
 SCCH-7                             32                    MVC.No.1095/2014




             Besides this amount the claimants are
             entitled to get Rupees 50,000/- each
             towards the loss of affection of the son, i.e.,
             Rupees 1,00,000/- and Rupees 10,000/- on
             account of funeral and ritual expenses.
             Therefore, the total amount comes to
             Rupees 20,64,800/- and the claimants are
             entitled to get the said amount of
             compensation instead of the amount
             awarded by the Tribunal and the High
             Court. They would also be entitled to get
             interst at the rate of 6% per annum from
             the date of the filing of the claim petition till
             realization.

for the following;
                              REASONS


      32.   ISSUE NO.1 IN M.V.C.NO.1097/2014 :- The P.W.1,
who is the Petitioner No.1 in M.V.C.No.1097/2014, has stated in
his examination-in-chief that, the Petitioner No.2 is his wife and
the deceased Syed Ayub Pasha was their son, who died in the road
traffic accident, which was taken place on 14.09.2013, when he
was traveling in the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration
No.KA-03-ML-9825 with 4 other persons including the driver Yasir
Khan and due to the said accident, his son Syed Ayub Pasha died
on the spot due to the accidental injuries. He has further stated
that, they were depending upon their son for their livelihood. The
Petitioners have produced Ex.P.1 FIR, Ex.P.2 Complaint, Ex.P.4
Inquest, Ex.P.5 Postmortem Report, Ex.P.6 Death Certificate
relating to Syed Ayub Pasha, Ex.P.16 B.Com Certificate relating to
Syed Ayub Pasha, Ex.P.17 Aashaar Card relating to Syed Iliyaz
Pasha, Ex.P.18 Aadahar Card relating to Raziya Sultana, Ex.P.19
Election Identity Card relating to Syed Ayub Pasha, Ex.P.20
Election Identity Card relating to Syed Iliyaz Pasha and Ex.P.21
Election Identity Card relating to Raziya Sultana. On perusal of
the said oral evidence of P.W.1 coupled with the contents of the
said material documents, it clearly goes to show that, the
Petitioner No.1 is a father and the Petitioner No.2 is a mother of
the deceased Syed Ayub Pasha, who died due to the accidental
injuries on the accidental spot itself on 14.09.2013 at 1-30 p.m.,
when he was traveling in the offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car
bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825, which hit to the BMTC
 SCCH-7                         35                 MVC.No.1095/2014




Bus bearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-1241. Hence, it can be
safely held that, the Petitioner No.1 being a father and the
Petitioner No.2 being a mother are the legal representatives of the
said deceased. But, based on the same, it cannot be said that,
both the Petitioners are the dependents upon the said deceased,
as, it is well settled principle of law that, the father cannot be
considered as a dependent upon the son and though the P.W.1 in
his cross-examination has stated that, he is not doing any work,
to consider the same, no acceptable material documentary
evidence is produced by the Petitioners. Hence, the Petitioners
No.2 being a mother of the deceased can only be considered as a
dependent upon the said deceased. Accordingly, I answered
Issue No.1 in M.V.C.No.1097/2014 partly in the Affirmative.


     33.    ISSUE NO.1 IN M.V.C.NO.1095/2014 :- The P.W.2,
who is the Petitioner No.1 in M.V.C.No.1095/2014, has stated in
his examination-in-chief that, the Petitioner No.2 is his wife and
the deceased Mohammed Junaid was their son, who died in the
road traffic accident, which was taken place on 14.09.2013, when
he was traveling in the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing
Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825 with 4 other persons including
the driver Yasir Khan and due to the said accident, his son
Mohammed Junaid died on the spot due to the accidental injuries.
He has further stated that, they were depending upon their son for
their livelihood. The Petitioners have produced Ex.P.11 Burial
Report dated 17.09.2013, Ex.P.12 Death Certificate relating to
Mohammed Junaid, Ex.P.15 Aadhaar Card relating to Mohammed
Junaid, Ex.P.22 SSLC Marks Card relating to Mohammed Junaid,

Aadahar Card relating to Moahmmed Sayeed, Ex.P.25 Aadhaar
Card relating to Asma Jabeen, Ex.P.35 Inquest and Ex.P.36
Postmortem Report. On perusal of the said oral evidence of P.W.2
coupled with the contents of the said material documents, it
clearly goes to show that, the Petitioner No.1 is a father and the
Petitioner No.2 is a mother of the deceased Mohammed Junaid,
who died due to the accidental injuries on the accidental spot
itself on 14.09.2013 at 1-30 p.m., when he was traveling in the
offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-
ML-9825, which hit to the BMTC Bus bearing Registration No.KA-
01-FA-1241. Hence, it can be safely held that, the Petitioner No.1
being a father and the Petitioner No.2 being a mother are the legal
representatives of the said deceased. But, based on the same, it
cannot be said that, both the Petitioners are the dependents upon
the said deceased, as, it is well settled principle of law that, the
father cannot be considered as a dependent upon the son.
Further, the P.W.2 in his cross-examination has clearly stated
that, he is working in a Hotel as a Assistant, which clearly
disclosed that, the Petitioner No.1, who is a father of the deceased
is having his own independent income. Hence, the Petitioners No.2
being a mother of the deceased can only be considered as a
dependent upon the said deceased. Accordingly, I answered
Issue No.1 in M.V.C.No.1095/2014 partly in the Affirmative


     34.    ISSUE NO.1 IN M.V.C.NO.1096/2014 :- The P.W.3,
who is the Petitioner No.1 in M.V.C.No.1096/2014, has stated in

the deceased Mayur Sharma was their son, who died in the road
traffic accident, which was taken place on 14.09.2013, when he
was traveling in the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration
No.KA-03-ML-9825 with 4 other persons including the driver Yasir
Khan and due to the said accident, his son Mayur Sharma died on
the spot due to the accidental injuries. He has further stated that,
they were depending upon their son for their livelihood. The
Petitioners     have   produced     Ex.P.26       Burial     Report    dated
15.09.2013, Ex.P.27 Death Certificate relating to Mayur Sharma,

Lakshmichand Sharma, Ex.P.37 Inquest and Ex.P.38 Postmortem
Report. On perusal of the said oral evidence of P.W.3 coupled with
the contents of the said material documents, it clearly goes to
show that, the Petitioner No.1 is a father and the Petitioner No.2 is
a mother of the deceased Mayur Sharma, who died due to the
accidental injuries on the accidental spot itself on 14.09.2013 at
1-30 p.m., when he was traveling in the offending Maruthi Swift
Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825, which hit to

considered as a dependent upon the son. Further, the P.W.3 in his
cross-examination has clearly stated that, he is working as a
Manager in Jain Trust, which clearly disclosed that, the Petitioner
No.1, who is a father of the deceased, is having his own
independent income. Hence, the Petitioners No.2 being a mother
of the deceased can only be considered as a dependent upon the
said     deceased.   Accordingly,     I   answered   Issue   No.1       in
M.V.C.No.1096/2014 partly in the Affirmative


       35.   ISSUE NO.2 IN ALL THE CASES :- The P.W.1, who is
the Petitioner No.1 in M.V.C.No.1097/2014 has stated in his
examination-in-chief that, on 14.09.2013 his deceased son Syed
Ayub Pasha was traveling in the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing
Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825 with 4 other including the driver
Yasir Khan and while they were moving in front of Sommanahalli
KEB Quarters on Bangalore - Kanakapura Road at about 1-10
p.m., the driver of the vehicle drove the vehicle in a rash and
negligent manner and due to the front right side tyre burst of the
Car, the driver of the vehicle lost control of the Car and the Car hit
to the BMTC Bus bearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-1241 and due
to the accident, all the 5 inmates of the Car including his deceased
son died on the spot due to the accidental injuries. He has further
stated that, on 14.09.2013, the said accident occurred due to the
rash and negligent act of the driver of the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car
bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825 and the Thalaghattapura
Police Station have registered a Case No.589/2013 as against the
driver of the said offending vehicle.
 SCCH-7                             39                    MVC.No.1095/2014




      36.   The   P.W.2,     who        is    the   Petitioner   No.1       in
M.V.C.No.1095/2014 has stated the same evidence of P.W.1, in
his   examination-in-chief   and        has   further   stated   that,      on
14.09.2013, his son deceased Mohammed Junaid was traveling in
the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-
9825, who died on the spot due to the accidental injuries.


      37.   The   P.W.3,     who        is    the   Petitioner   No.1       in
M.V.C.No.1096/2014 has also stated the same evidence of P.W.1
and P.W.2, in his examination-in-chief and has further stated

traveling in the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration
No.KA-03-ML-9825, who died on the spot due to the accidental
injuries.


      38.   No doubt, the P.W.1 to P.W.3 are not the eye witnesses
of the accident in question. In this regard, they have stated in
their cross-examination that, they have not seen the accident.
Further, the P.W.1 to P.W.3 have not lodged the complaint about
the alleged accident before the jurisdictional Police in respect of
the accident caused to their respective sons. In this regard, the
P.W.1 to P.W.3 have also stated in their cross-examination that,
they have not lodged a complaint about the alleged accident.
Further, the P.W.1 to P.W.3 have clearly stated in their cross-
examination that, they have not challenged the Charge Sheet filed
by the concerned Police by alleging that, at the time of accident,
all the inmates of the Car including their son are not under the
influence of intoxication. They have clearly stated that, they have
 SCCH-7                         40                 MVC.No.1095/2014




not challenged the Charge Sheet filed by the Investigating Officer
by preferring an appeal before the Hon&#x27;ble Appellate Court. It is
pertinent to note here that, after investigation, the Investigating
Officer has filed the Charge Sheet as against the driver of the
offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-
ML-9825, namely, Yasir Khan, wherein, all 3 deceased were
traveling in the said Maruthi Swift Dzire Car. It is further
pertinent to note here that, in the Charge Sheet, it is alleged by
the Investigating Officer that, at the time of accident, the said
driver Yasir Khan was under the influence of intoxication. Further,
the P.W.1 to P.W.3 have shown their ignorance about the contents
of the Charge Sheet as well as the complaint that, they do not
know the contents of the complaint and the Police have filed the
Charge Sheet as against the driver of the Car, namely, Yaseer
Khan. Further, they have stated that, they do not know that, due
to very high speed, rash and negligent manner of driving of the
said Car, the said accident was taken place. Further, the
Petitioners have not produced the Spot Hand Sketch to know the
scene of the accident in question. Further, the R.W.1, who is the
Assistant Professor, Department of Forensic Medicine, Karwar
Institute of Medical Sciences, Karwar, has produced Ex.R.2 FSL
Report dated 30.01.2014 and has stated in his cross-examination
that, he has conducted the examination of postmortem of
Mohammed Junaid, Mayur Sharma and Syed Ayub Pasha and the
blood of the said persons was sent to FSL for examination and
report and he has entered the cause of death in Postmortem
Reports and if a person is having alcohol contents of 30 mili
grams per 100 mili blood, he can be considered as under alcoholic

intoxication and if a person having 50 mili grams alcoholic
contents per 100 mili blood, he is not under his control and at
the time of postmortem examination, the bodies of the said
persons were fresh. Further, the R.W.2, who is the Manager-Legal
of the Respondent No.2 has stated in his examination-in-chief
that, all deceased were consumed the alcohol at the time of
traveling in Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-
03-ML-9823 at about 4-10 p.m., on 14.03.2013 and as per the
postmortem report, the Hospital Authority/Doctor have mentioned
the percentage of alcohol consumed by the deceased. He has
further stated that, their Insurance Company had lead the

deceased Mohammed Junaid 55.6 mg/100 ml of blood, deceased
Mayur Sharma 50.6/10 ml and deceased Syed Ayub Pasha
65.4/100 ml blood. He has further stated that, it clearly shows
that, all the deceased including driver of the Car were drunk at
the time of accident and the accident was occurred due to the
highly consumption of alcohol of the deceased not due to the burst
of the tyre of the offending vehicle. He has further stated in his
cross-examination that, there is mentioned in postmortem reports
relating to the deceased that, the deceased were consumed the
alcohol and in Ex.R.1 Charge Sheet, it is mentioned that, the front
Car wheel was burst. Further, the Respondent No.4 has examined
the driver of the BMTC Bus bearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-
1241 as R.W.3, who has stated in his examination-in-chief that,
on   14.09.2013,   he   was manning     the   BMTC   Bus bearing
 SCCH-7                          42                 MVC.No.1095/2014

he was proceeding in a road in front of Somanahally KEB Gate,
slowly, cautiously by following all the traffic rules in extreme left
side of the road (on mud road adjacent to the tar road), at that
point of time, the driver of the Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration
No.KA-03-ML-9825 came in a opposite direction, rash and
negligently with high speed in reckless manner under the
intoxication of alcohol along with other inmates of the Car, those
were also under the intoxication of alcohol and all of a sudden
deviated to extreme right side of the Car (wrong direction) and
dashed against the BMTC Bus in a high speed at left side of the
Bus and caused the alleged accident and the alleged accident was

Swift Car and he is not responsible in any manner and as such,
the Talaghattapura Police have registered a case as against the
driver of the Swift Car in Crime No.589/2013 and subsequently,
Charge Sheet has also been filed as against the driver of the Car.
He has further stated that, the alleged accident is not due to his
fault and therefore, his Corporation is not liable to pay any

further stated that, as per the petition averments, the alleged
accident is caused by driver of the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing
Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825 and the Police Officials Charge
Sheeted the driver of the Maruthi Swift Car and therefore, the

     39.   But, based on the said grounds, it cannot be said that,
the contributory negligence is also attributed on the part of the
deceased Mohammed Junaid, Mayur Sharma and Syed Aub Pasha
in driving the   offending Maruthi     Swift   Dzire   Car   bearing
Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825 by driving its driver, which was
driving by the deceased Yasir Khan and the entire negligence is
not on the part of the driver Yasir Khan in driving the Maruthi
Swift Dzire Car, as, the Petitioners in M.V.C.No.1097/2014 have
produced Ex.P.1 FIR, Ex.P.2 Complaint, Ex.P.3 Spot Panchanama,
Ex.P.4 Inquest, Ex.P.5 Postmortem Report and Ex.P.6 Death

which clearly disclosed that, the said deceased were the inmates
of the said offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration

driver of the said offending Car was driving it with very high
speed, rash and negligent manner and due to which itself, the
front wheel of the said Car was burst and the deceased driver had
lost his control over the said Car and due to which, he dashed the
offending Car to the BMTC Bus bearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-
1241, which was coming on the opposite side from Bangalore and
due to the said impact, the offending Car entered into the lower
part of the Bus and due to which, the entire Car was damaged and
 SCCH-7                         44                 MVC.No.1095/2014




the deceased driver Yasir Khan and the inmates, i.e., the deceased
Mohammed Junaid, Mayur Sharma and Syed Aub Pasha had
sustained severe grievous injuries on their head and all over the
body and all 5 persons are died on the accidental spot itself and
the driver of the said offending Car, namely, Yasir Khan was
under the influence of alcohol at the time of accident and as such,
the entire negligence is on the part of the deceased driver of the
offending Car, which is clear from the following discussion.
Further, the P.W.1 to P.W.3 have clearly stated in their cross-
examination that, the said Car was owned by Naseer Hussain, i.e.,
the Respondent No.1 and the deceased driver of the said offending
Car, namely, Yasir Khar S/o. Naseer Hussain is a son of the
Respondent No.1. It is pertinent to note here that, though the
notice was duly served on the Respondent No.1, he was remained
absent and hence, he is placed as exparte. If really, there was no
negligence on the part of the driver of the said offending Car,
namely, Yasir Khan S/o. Naseer Hussain, in the commission of
the said road traffic accident and the said accident was taken
place due to burst of the front wheel of the said Car and due to
which, the said deceased driver had not controlled over the said
Car and the said deceased driver was not under the influence of
alcohol at the time of accident, the Respondent No.1 being a father
of the said deceased driver and owner of the said offending Car
could have been definitely challenged the very registration of the
criminal case as against his deceased son, by preferring an appeal
or revision before the Hon&#x27;ble Appellate Court. Further, the
Respondent No.1 could have definitely contested all the petitions
by filing the Written Statement. The non-appearance of the
 SCCH-7                          45                MVC.No.1095/2014




Respondent No.1 in all the petitions clearly implies that, he has
indirectly admitted the entire case made out by the Petitioners as
against his deceased son, who was a driver of the offending
Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825.
When the entire negligence is on the part of the deceased driver of
the said offending Swift Dzire Car, non-challenging of the Charge
Sheet by all the Petitioners by preferring an appeal or revision
before the Hon&#x27;ble Appellate Court questioning the allegations
made by the Investigating Officer in the Charge Sheet that, at the
time of accident, all the inmates of the Car including their were
sons under intoxication, cannot be arise for consideration at all.
Further, the P.W.1 to P.W.3 have clearly stated in their cross-

about the accident and on that day, there were 5 persons in the
Car and the right tye of the said Car was burst. Furthermore, the
Respondent No.2 has not produced Investigation Report, which is
prepared by their Investigating Officer. Further, the R.W.1 has
clearly admitted the contents of Ex.P.34 MVI Report, which clearly
disclosed about the damages caused to the offending Maruthi
Swift Dzire Car. Further, the R.W.3 has clearly stated in his cross-
examination that, at the time of accident, his Bus was not moving,
but, it was about to moving and the left side of their Bus was
damaged. He has further stated that, the width of the accidental
road was 35-40 ft. On perusal of the said evidence of R.W.3, it is
further made crystal clear that, if the deceased driver of the

not driving with it with very high speed, rash and negligent
manner at the time of accident, he could have avoided the said
road traffic accident and could have saved the valuable life of all

influence of alcohol at the time of accident. But, while discussing
above, this Tribunal has already observed and come to the
conclusion that, there was no contributory negligence on the part
of the said deceased in the commission of the said road traffic
accident and the entire negligence is on the part of the driver of
the offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-
03-ML-9825, namely, Yasir Khan, who was driving it with very
high speed, rash and negligent manner at the time of accident and

<a href="/doc/139481594/" id="a_32">Section 185</a> of IMV Act. From this, it is made crystal clear that,

offending Car at the time of accident had sustained grievous
injuries on their head and all over the body and died on the
accidental   spot   including     the   said   driver.   Accordingly,       I
answered        Issues      No.2        in      M.V.C.No.1097/2014,
M.V.C.No.1095/2014         and      M.V.C.No.1096/2014            in    the
Affirmative.


     48.     ISSUES        NO.3         IN      M.V.C.NO.1097/2014,
M.V.C.NO.1095/2014 AND M.V.C.NO.1096/2014 :-


     49.     ISSUE NO.3 IN M.V.C.NO.1097/2014 :- The P.W.1
has stated that, at the time of accident, his son was only aged 22
years. The Petitioners have produced Ex.P.19 Election Identity
Card relating to the deceased Syed Ayub Pasha, which disclosed
that, the date of birth of the deceased is on 31.10.1989. The date
of accident is on 14.09.2013. On perusal of the said dates, it
appears that, at the time of accident, the said deceased was 24
years old. Hence, the age of the deceased is considered as 24 years
at the time of accident.


     50.     The P.W.1 has stated that, his deceased son was
employed in IBM Daksh Business Process Services Pvt. Ltd.,
Manyata Embassy Business Park, Block D4, 1st Floor, Outer Ring
Road, Nagawara, Bangalore - 45 and he was earning Rupees
15,000/- p.m. Further, the P.W.1 in his cross-examination has
 SCCH-7                         52                MVC.No.1095/2014




stated that, his deceased son was working as an Accountant in

Annexure, Ex.P.8 Welcome Letter, Ex.P.9 Appointment Letter
dated 23.12.2011 along with Annexure and Ex.P.16 B.Com
Certificate relating to the deceased. On perusal of the said
evidence of P.W.1 as well as the contents of the said material
documents, it appears that, the deceased Syed Ayub Pasha was
B.Com Graduate at the time of accident and he was working as a
Practitioner-CRM Operations at IBM Daksh Business Process
Services (P) Ltd., from 11.01.2012 to 14.09.2013 and the said
Company has paid the death benefits of the said deceased as full
and final settlement. But, the Petitioners have not produced any
authenticated documents to show that, at the time of accident, the
said deceased was earning Rupees 15,000/- p.m. Further, the
P.W.1 in his cross-examination has stated that, he has not
produced the pay slips relating to his deceased son and 18
months prior to the accident, his deceased son was working in the
said Company. Further, the P.W.1 in his cross-examination has
stated that, he has no hurdle to examine the employer of his
deceased son to consider his income at the time of accident.
Further, the employer of the deceased also not been examined by
the Petitioners. Hence, the income of the said deceased of Rupees
15,000/- as stated by the P.W.1 cannot be believed and accept.
However, at the time of accident, the deceased was 24 years old
and he was a bachelor and he was a B.Com Graduate and he was
working as a Practitioner-CRM Operation and he is having the
Petitioners as his parents, by considering the same, this Tribunal
 SCCH-7                           53                MVC.No.1095/2014




feels that, it is just, proper and necessary to consider the notional
income of the deceased is of Rupees 10,000/- p.m. Hence, the
notional income of the deceased is considered as Rupees 10,000/-
p.m., at the time of accident.


     51.    The P.W.1 has stated that, at the time of accident, his
son deceased Syed Ayub Pasha was hale, healthy and hard
working and was having bright future and further his son was
supporting his family financially and due to the death of his son in
the said accident, they are finding extremely difficult to eake out
their livelihood and they are put heavy financial stress and
further, they are put to untold misery, financial loss, mental agony
and hardship due to the tragic death of their son in the said
accident.


     52.    While answering Issue No.1, this Tribunal has already
observed and come to the conclusion that, the Petitioners are the
legal representatives and the Petitioner No.2 is a dependent upon
the said deceased. While answering Issue No.2, this Tribunal has
already observed and come to the conclusion that, the entire
negligence is on the part of the deceased driver, namely, Yasir
Khan S/o. Nasir Khan in the commission of the said road traffic
accident, who was driving the offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car
bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825 and he and the said
offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car are very much involved in the
said road traffic accident, wherein, the deceased Syed Ayub Pasha,
who was traveling in the said offending Car at the time of accident
had sustained grievous injuries on his head and all over the body
 SCCH-7                             54                 MVC.No.1095/2014




and died on the accidental spot including the said driver. Hence,
the Petitioners No.1 and 2 being the legal representatives and the
Petitioner No.2 being a dependent upon the said deceased are
entitled for compensation under the following heads.


     53.    As per the decision reported in 2013 ACJ 1403
(Rajesh and Others V/s Rajbir Singh and Others) and as the
deceased was aged 24 years at the time of accident, towards
future prospects 50% of the income has to be added. So, 50% of
Rupees 10,000/- comes to Rupees 5,000/-. Therefore, the income
of the deceased comes to Rupees 15,000/- p.m. (Rs.10,000/- +
5,000/-).


     54.    The Petitioner No.2 is considered as a dependent of the
deceased. Therefore, deceased left behind one dependent. As per
the principles laid down in ILR 2012 KAR 2859 (New India
Assurance Co. Ltd., represented by Senior Divisional Manager
V/s. Sri. David. T. and Another), whenever there is a sole
dependent, deduction of 50% towards personal expenses is
proper. Therefore, considering the number of the dependent, i.e.,
1, 50% of the income has to be deducted towards personal
expenses    of   the   deceased,    i.e.,   Rupees   7,500/-   (50%      of
Rs.15,000/-). Therefore, loss of dependency comes to Rupees
7,500/- (Rs.15,000/- (-) Rs.7,500/-). The multiplier corresponding
to the age of the deceased, i.e., 24 years, is 18 as per Sarala
Varma&#x27;s Case. Therefore, loss of dependency comes to Rupees
16,20,000/- (Rs.7,500/- x 12 x 18). Therefore, the Petitioners are
 SCCH-7                           55                   MVC.No.1095/2014




entitled for Rupees 16,20,000/- towards loss of dependency due to
death of Syed Ayub Pasha S/o Syed illyaz Pasha.


      55.   The P.W.1 has stated that, due to the accident, they
were made to spent Rupees 50,000/- towards the funeral
ceremony and such other expenses of their son. In this regard, the
Petitioners have not produced any scrap of paper.


      56.   As per the principles laid down in the decision reported
in 2013 ACJ 1403 (Rajesh and Others V/s. Rajbir Singh and
Others), loss of love and affection has to be compensated by
awarding Rupees 25,000/- and funeral expenses should be
Rupees 25,000/-. As this Tribunal has already observed that, the
Petitioner No.1 is a father and the Petitioner No.2 is a mother of
the deceased. Hence, the Petitioners are entitled for a sum of
Rupees 25,000/- towards loss of love and affection and Rupees
25,000/- towards funeral expenses.


      57.   It is just, proper and necessary to award a sum of
Rupees 5,000/- towards transportation expenses of the dead body
of deceased and Rupees 20,000/- towards loss of estate. Hence,
the   Petitioners   are   entitled    for   Rupees   5,000/-    towards
transportation expenses of the dead body of the deceased and
Rupees 20,000/- towards loss of estate.


      58.   In this way, the Petitioners are entitled for the following
amount of compensation:-
 SCCH-7                                56                   MVC.No.1095/2014




 Sl. No.        Compensation heads               Compensation amount
   1.         Loss of Dependency                  Rs.    16,20,000-00

              of dead body

                           TOTAL                  Rs.   16,95,000-00


        59.    In   all,    the    Petitioners   are    entitled   for   total
compensation of Rupees 16,95,000/- along with interest at the
rate of 8% per annum on the above said sum from the date of

has stated that, at the time of death, his son was only aged 21
years. The Petitioners have produced Ex.P.22 SSLC Marks Card
relating to the deceased Mohammed Junaid, which disclosed that,
his date of birth is on 20.05.1992. The date of accident is on
14.09.2013. On perusal of the said dates, it appears that, at the
time of accident, the said deceased was 22 years old. Hence, the
age of the deceased is considered as 22 years at the time of
accident.


        61.    The P.W.2 has stated that, his deceased son was
studying in 2nd PUC and along with his studies, he was also doing

salary was Rupees 15,928/- p.m. The P.W.2 in his cross-
examination has stated that, his deceased son was working as a
Clerk in Aditya Birla Minacs Worldwide Ltd., Bangalore. The
Petitioners have produced Ex.P.13 Pay Slip for the Month of July
2011 and Ex.P.14 Appointment dated 21.04.2011 along with
Annexure. The said evidence of P.W.2 as well as the contents of
Ex.P.13 and Ex.P.14 disclosed that, at the time of accident, the
said deceased was working at Aditya Birla Minacs Worldwide
Limited and his Gross Salary was of Rupees 15,928/- p.m., and
Net Salary was of Rupees 14,539/-. But, based on the same, it
cannot be said and come to the conclusion that, at the time of
accident, the said deceased was earning Rupees 15,928/- p.m., as
Gross Salary and Rupees 14,539/- p.m., as Net Salary, as,
Ex.P.13 Pay Slip is relating to the Month of July 2011, which is
much prior to the date of accident. Further, the Petitioners have
not produced the pay slip of the said deceased covering the date of
accident and the Bank Statement to show the actual income of the
deceased at the time of accident. Even, the Petitioners have not
examined the employer of the said deceased to consider his nature
of work and income at the time of accident. In this regard, the
P.W.2 in his cross-examination has clearly stated that, he has not
produced the pay slips relating to his deceased son for the year
2013 and also the Bank statement to show his actual income at
the time of accident. Though the P.W.2 has further stated that, 6
months prior to the accident, his deceased son was working in the
said Company and they have no hurdle to examine the employer
of his deceased son, the Petitioners did not care to examine the
employer of the said deceased. Hence, the income of the said
 SCCH-7                          58                MVC.No.1095/2014




deceased, which is of Rupees 15,928/- p.m., as stated by the
P.W.2 cannot be taken into for consideration. However, at the time
of accident, the deceased was 22 years and he has passed SSLC
and he was having Petitioners as his parents, by considering the
same, this Tribunal feels that, it is just, proper and necessary to
consider the notional income of the deceased is of Rupees 9,000/-
p.m., at the time of accident. Hence, the notional income of the
deceased is considered as Rupees 9,000/- p.m., at the time of
accident.


     62.    The P.W.2 has stated that, at the time of accident, his
son deceased Mohammed Junaid was hale, healthy and hard
working and was having bright future and further his son was
supporting his family financially and due to the death of his son in
the said accident, they are finding extremely difficult to eake out
their livelihood and they are put heavy financial stress and
further, they are put to untold misery, financial loss, mental agony
and hardship due to the tragic death of their son in the said
accident.


     63.    While answering Issue No.1, this Tribunal has already
observed and come to the conclusion that, the Petitioners are the
legal representatives and the Petitioner No.2 is a dependent upon
the said deceased. While answering Issue No.2, this Tribunal has
already observed and come to the conclusion that, the entire
negligence is on the part of the deceased driver, namely, Yasir
Khan S/o. Nasir Khan in the commission of the said road traffic
accident, who was driving the offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car
 SCCH-7                             59                 MVC.No.1095/2014




bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825 and he and the said
offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car are very much involved in the
said road traffic accident, wherein, the deceased, Mohammed
Junid, who was traveling in the said offending Car at the time of
accident had sustained grievous injuries on his head and all over
the body and died on the accidental spot including the said driver.
Hence, the Petitioners No.1 and 2 being the legal representatives
and the Petitioner No.2 being a dependent upon the said
deceased, are entitled for compensation under the following heads.


    64.     As per the decision reported in 2013 ACJ 1403
(Rajesh and Others V/s. Rajbir Singh and Others) and as the
deceased was aged 22 years at the time of accident, towards
future prospects 50% of the income has to be added. So, 50% of
Rupees 9,000/- comes to Rupees 4,500/-. Therefore, the income
of the deceased comes to Rupees 13,500/- p.m. (Rs.9,000/- +
4,500/-).


    65.     The Petitioner No.2 is considered as a dependent of the
deceased. Therefore, deceased left behind one dependent. As per
the principles laid down in ILR 2012 KAR 2859 (New India
Assurance Co. Ltd., represented by Senior Divisional Manager
V/s. Sri. David. T. and Another), whenever there is a sole
dependent, deduction of 50% towards personal expenses is
proper. Therefore, considering the number of the dependent, i.e.,
1, 50% of the income has to be deducted towards personal
expenses    of   the   deceased,    i.e.,   Rupees   6,750/-   (50%      of
Rs.13,500/-). Therefore, loss of dependency comes to Rupees
 SCCH-7                            60                   MVC.No.1095/2014




6,750/- (Rs.13,500/- (-) Rs.6,750/-). The multiplier corresponding
to the age of the deceased, i.e., 22 years, is 18 as per Sarala
Varma&#x27;s Case. Therefore, loss of dependency comes to Rupees
14,58,000/- (Rs.6,750/- x 12 x 18). Therefore, the Petitioners are
entitled for Rupees 14,58,000/- towards loss of dependency due to
death of Mohammed Junaid S/o Mohammed Syed.


      66.   The P.W.2 has stated that, due to the accident, they
were made to spent Rupees 50,000/- towards the funeral
ceremony and such other expenses of their son. In this regard, the
Petitioners have not produced any scrap of paper.


      67.   As per the principles laid down in the decision reported
in 2013 ACJ 1403 (Rajesh and Others V/s. Rajbir Singh and
Others), loss of love and affection has to be compensated by
awarding Rupees 25,000/- and funeral expenses should be
Rupees 25,000/-. As this Tribunal has already observed that, the
Petitioner No.1 is a father and the Petitioner No.2 is a mother of
the deceased. Hence, the Petitioners are entitled for a sum of
Rupees 25,000/- towards loss of love and affection and Rupees
25,000/- towards funeral expenses.


      68.   It is just, proper and necessary to award a sum of
Rupees 5,000/- towards transportation expenses of the dead body
of deceased and Rupees 20,000/- towards loss of estate. Hence,
the    Petitioners   are   entitled    for   Rupees   5,000/-    towards
transportation expenses of the dead body of the deceased and
Rupees 20,000/- towards loss of estate.
 SCCH-7                                61                   MVC.No.1095/2014




    69.        In this way, the Petitioners are entitled for the following
amount of compensation:-


 Sl. No.        Compensation heads               Compensation amount
   1.         Loss of Dependency                  Rs.    14,58,000-00
   2.         Funeral Expenses                    Rs.        25,000-00
   3.         Loss of Love and affection          Rs.        25,000-00
   4.         Expenses of transportation          Rs.         5,000-00
              of dead body
   5.         Loss of Estate                      Rs.        20,000-00

                           TOTAL                  Rs.   15,33,000-00


        70.    In   all,    the    Petitioners   are    entitled   for   total
compensation of Rupees 15,33,000/- along with interest at the
rate of 8% per annum on the above said sum from the date of
petition till payment.


        71.    ISSUE NO.3 IN M.V.C.NO.1096/2014 :-                 The P.W.3
has stated that, at the time of death, his son was only aged 21
years. The Petitioners have produced Ex.P.29 SSLC Marks Card
relating to the deceased Mayur Sharma. L., and Ex.P.30 Election
Identity Card relating to Mayur Sharma. L., which disclosed that,
his date of birth is on 10.05.1992. The date of accident is on
14.09.2013. On perusal of the said dates, it appears that, at the
time of accident, the said deceased was 22 years old. Hence, the
age of the deceased is considered as 22 years at the time of
accident.
 SCCH-7                         62                 MVC.No.1095/2014




      72.   The P.W.3 has stated that, his deceased son was doing
Mobile Servicing Job and was employed in M/s. Chandan Agency,
Castle Street, Ashok Nagar, Bangalore and he was earning Rupees
16,000/- p.m. He has further stated in his cross-examination
that, his deceased son was completed SSLC at the time of accident
and he was working as a Recharger in M/s. Chandan Agencies.
The   Petitioners   have   produced   Ex.P.28   Certificate   dated
14.01.2015 issued by M/s. Chandan Agency, which disclosed
that, the deceased was an employee of the said Firm from
01.08.2011 to 13.09.2013 and he was paid a monthly salary of
Rupees 16,000/- and last salary was paid to him on 05.09.2013.
But, only based on the said oral evidence of P.W.3 as well as the
contents of Ex.P.28, it cannot be believed and accept that, at the
time of accident, the deceased Mayur Sharma was doing Mobile
Servicing Job and was employed in M/s. Chandan Agency, by
drawing a salary of Rupees 16,000/- p.m., as, the Petitioners have
not examined the employer of the deceased and they have not
produced the Bank Statement. Hence, the income of the said
deceased, which is of Rupees 16,000/- p.m., as stated by the
P.W.3 cannot be taken into for consideration. However, at the time
of accident, the deceased was 22 years and he has passed SSLC
and he was having Petitioners as his parents, by considering the
same, this Tribunal feels that, it is just, proper and necessary to
consider the notional income of the deceased is of Rupees 9,000/-
p.m., at the time of accident. Hence, the notional income of the
deceased is considered as Rupees 9,000/- p.m., at the time of
accident.

     73.    The P.W.3 has stated that, at the time of accident, his
son deceased Mayur Sharma was hale and healthy and hard
working and was having bright future and further his son was
supporting his family financially and due to the death of his son in
the said accident, they are finding extremely difficult to eake out

accident.


     74.    While answering Issue No.1, this Tribunal has already
observed and come to the conclusion that, the Petitioners are the
legal representatives and the Petitioner No.2 is a dependent upon
the said deceased. While answering Issue No.2, this Tribunal has
already observed and come to the conclusion that, the entire
negligence is on the part of the deceased driver, namely, Yasir
Khan S/o. Nasir Khan in the commission of the said road traffic
accident, who was driving the offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car
bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825 and he and the said
offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car are very much involved in the
said road traffic accident, wherein, the deceased, Mayur Sharma.
L., who was traveling in the said offending Car at the time of
accident had sustained grievous injuries on his head and all over
the body and died on the accidental spot including the said driver.
Hence, the Petitioners No.1 and 2 being the legal representatives
and the Petitioner No.2 being a dependent upon the said
deceased, are entitled for compensation under the following heads.
 SCCH-7                             64                 MVC.No.1095/2014




     75.    As per the decision reported in 2013 ACJ 1403
(Rajesh and Others V/s. Rajbir Singh and Others) and as the
deceased was aged 22 years at the time of accident, towards
future prospects 50% of the income has to be added. So, 50% of

of the deceased comes to Rupees 13,500/- p.m. (Rs.9,000/- +
4,500/-).


     76.    The Petitioner No.2 is considered as a dependent of the

further stated that, at the time of accident, the Respondent No.1
was a Owner of the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration
No.KA-03-ML-9825 and the Respondent No.2 was the Insurer of
the said Car bearing Policy No.23112001877331011000, valid

 SCCH-7                                67                        MVC.No.1095/2014




Khan in the commission of the said road traffic accident, who was
driving the offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration
No.KA-03-ML-9825 and he and the said offending Maruthi Swift
Dzire Car are very much involved in the said road traffic accident,
wherein, the deceased Syed Ayub Pasha, Mohammed Junid,
Mayur Sharma and Yarab Abbas, who were traveling in the said
offending Car at the time of accident had sustained grievous
injuries on their head and all over the body and died on the
accidental spot including the said driver. It is clearly mentioned by
the respective Petitioners in the cause title of the petitions that,
the Respondent No.1 is an Owner and the Respondent No.2 is an
Insurer of the offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing
Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825 and the Respondent No.3 is a
driver and the Respondent No.4 is the Owner of the BMTC Bus
bearing   Registration    No.KA-01-FA-1241.               The     Petitioners      in
M.V.C.No.1097/2014 have produced Ex.P.10 B-Register Extract
relating to vehicle bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825, i.e.,
the offending Car. The Respondent No.2 in its written statement
has   clearly   stated   that,   it        has   issued    a     Policy   bearing
No.23112001877331011000 in respect of Maruthi Swift Dzire Car
bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9823 and the said policy was in
force from 28.01.2013 to 27.01.2014 and without prejudice to the
confirmation of the policy, the liability of it, if any, will be
subjected to the terms and conditions of the policy, verification of
Engine and Chassis Number, the validity and the effective driving
licence of the rider of the vehicle and subjected to the provisions of
the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_33">M.V. Act</a>. The R.W.2, who is a Manager-Legal of the
Respondent No.2 has stated in his examination-in-chief that, the
 SCCH-7                           68               MVC.No.1095/2014




third     Respondent      had    issued     the   policy    bearing
No.23112001877331011000 in respect of Swift Dzire Car bearing
Registration No.KA-03-ML-9823 and the said policy was in force
from 28.01.2013 to 27.01.2014. On perusal of the said oral
evidence of P.W.1 to P.W.3, the contents of Ex.P.10 B-Register
Extract, contentions taken by the Respondent No.2 in his written
statement and the evidence of R.W.2, it appears that, at the time
of accident, the Respondent No.1 was a R.C. Owner and the
Respondent No.2 was an Insurer of the offending Swift Dzire Car
bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9823 and its Insurance Policy
was valid, which covers the date of accident. It is also clear from
the pleadings and evidence of P.W.1 to P.W.3 that, at the time of
accident, the R.W.3, i.e., the Respondent No.3 was a driver of the
BMTC Bus bearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-1241. Further, there
is no allegations leveled by the Investigating Officer in Ex.R.1
Charge Sheet as against the deceased driver of the offending Swift
Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9823 that, he was
not having a valid and effective driving licence to drive such class
of offending Car at the time of accident.


        84.   But, based on the said reasons, it cannot be said and
come to the conclusion that, the Respondent No.1 being a R.C.
Owner and the Respondent No.2 being an Insurer of the offending
Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9823 are jointly
and severally liable to pay the compensation and interest to the all
the Petitioners, as, while answering Issue No.2 in all the cases,
this Tribunal has already observed and come to the conclusion
that, at the time of accident, the deceased driver of the offending
 SCCH-7                           69                   MVC.No.1095/2014




Car was under influence of alcohol. Further, it is clearly alleged by
the Investigating Officer in Ex.R.1 Charge Sheet that, at the time
of accident, the deceased driver of the offending Car was under the
influence of alcohol and as such, he has inserted <a href="/doc/139481594/" id="a_34">Section 185</a> of
M.V. Act along with <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_35">Sections 279</a> and <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_36">304(A)</a> of IPC. Hence, the
Respondent No.1 being a R.C. Owner of the said offending Swift
Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9823, is alone liable
to pay the compensation to all the Petitioners. Hence, the petitions
filed by the Petitioners are liable to be allowed as against the
Respondent No.1 and they are liable to dismissed as against the
Respondent No.2 and 4. It is pertinent to note here that, the
petitions filed by the Petitioners as against the Respondent No.3
was dismissed on 17.10.2014 as steps not taken. In view of the
above said reasons and findings on Issues, the principles
enunciated in the decision cited by the Learned Counsel appearing
for the Petitioners are applicable to some extent. Hence, Issues
No.3     in   M.V.C.No.1097/2014,      M.V.C.No.1095/2014           and
M.V.C.No.1096/2014 are answered accordingly.


       85.    ISSUE NO.4 IN M.V.C.No.1097/2014 :- For the
aforesaid reasons, I proceed to pass the following;
