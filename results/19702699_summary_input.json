As per the present petition, the deceased was driving his car bearing\nregistration No. DL-6CG-3615 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Accidental Car&quot;) and\nwas going from Delhi towards Karnal via GT Karnal Road.

The deceased was driving the accidental\ncar at a normal speed at the relevant time, but in order to give way to other\nvehicles which were coming from behind at a very fast speed, the deceased\nmoved the accidental car slightly to his right and due to this sideways movement,\nthe accidental car struck against the stationary offending vehicle. Due to impact,\nthe offending vehicle jumped across to the other carriageway and fell in a ditch.\nWhereas the occupants of offending vehicle sustained injuries, the deceased\nsuccumbed to his injuries on the spot. One of the occupants of the offending\nvehicle namely Sh. Mool Chand Gupta, who was standing outside the offending\nvehicle near the spot of accident, witnessed the said accident; which accident\noccurred as the offending vehicle was parked in the middle of road for changing a\npunctured tyre. As per the petition, the accident took place solely due to the\nnegligence of R-1 (driver) in parking the offending vehicle in the middle of road\nand who fled from the spot after the accident. Two police officials, who were on\npatrolling duty, reached at the spot and recorded the statement of Sh. Mool Chand\nGupta and an FIR U/s 283/304A <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a> was registered at PS Madhuban, Distt.\nKarnal in respect of the above accident. Hence, the present petition seeking\ncompensation to the tune of Rs. 50 Crores from R-1 who was the driver of the\noffending vehicle, R-2 who was the owner of the offending vehicle and R-3 who\nwas the Insurer of the offending vehicle.\n\n3.      R-1 and R-2 were served by way of publication but they did not bother to\njoin the proceedings and were proceeded against ex-parte on 20.03.2002.\n\n4.      R-3 filed written statement wherein it raised following preliminary objections\nto avoid liability : that R-1 was not holding any driving licence to drive the\noffending vehicle, that the offending vehicle was being used in contravention of\nthe terms and conditions of its permit and insurance policy, and that the petition     is\n                                                                          Digitally signed\n                                                                          by LOVLEEN\n                                                                  LOVLEEN       Date:\n                                                                                2020.12.01\n                                                                                17:48:01 +0530\nMACT Case No. 356688/16   Usha Goel Vs   Chetan Sharma &amp; Ors         Page No. 3 /43\n bad for non-joinder of the owner and insurer of accidental car. On merits, R-3\nclaimed that the offending vehicle was parked on the Kachcha portion of the road\nand indicators/ flashers were also turned on at the time of changing the punctured\ntyre but the present accident occurred as the deceased was driving the accidental\ncar in a rash and negligent manner and at a very fast speed and due to which he\n(deceased) lost control over accidental car leading to the present accident. Rest\nof the factual averments were denied by R-3.\n\n5.      The petitioners filed a replication to the written statement of R-3 wherein\nthey averred that R-1 was holding a valid driving licence at the relevant time,\nwhich was seized by the police during investigation and a copy of which was\nsupplied to the petitioners, which copy is available on the record. The petitioners\ndenied that the offending vehicle was being plied in contravention of the terms\nand conditions of its permit and insurance policy. Petitioners denied the rest of\nthe averments made by R-3 in its WS.\n\n                                           ISSUES\n\n6.

It may be noted here that there is an error in the wording of the present\nissue because the offending vehicle (HR-26J-8328) was stationary at the time of\naccident and the accidental car struck it from behind. Hence, this Tribunal is\nsupposed to return a finding as to any wrongful act, neglect or default of R-1 in\nparking the offending vehicle in the middle of the road at the relevant time in order\nto change a punctured tyre.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"153452910\" id=\"span_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"134749096\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"430786\" id=\"span_10\">19.      It is well settled that the procedure followed for proceedings conducted by\nan accident tribunal is similar to that followed by a civil court and in civil matters\nthe facts are required to be established by preponderance of probabilities only\nand not by strict rules of evidence or beyond reasonable doubts, as are required\nin a criminal prosecution. The burden of proof in a civil case is never as heavy as\nin a criminal case, but in a claim petition under the <a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_4\">M.V. Act</a>, this burden is infact\neven lesser than that in a civil case.

Keeping in view the above parameters, this Tribunal proceeds to decide the\n matter on the basis of evidence placed on record by either of the parties. It is not\n disputed that both the vehicles were on the same carriageway of the road at the\n relevant time. In other words the accidental car was proceeding in the same\n direction in which the offending vehicle would have gone but for a punctured tyre.\n It may be noted here for the sake of convenience that the petitioners have\n averred (i) that the offending vehicle was wrongly parked in the middle of the\n road by R-1 and, (ii) that the deceased, in order to give way to other vehicles\n coming at fast speed from behind, moved the accidental car slightly to his right\n and all of a sudden dashed against the offending vehicle. From the pleadings, it\n seems that the petitioners are trying to establish the wrongful act/default of R-1\n in parking the offending vehicle in the middle of road and at the same time they\n are trying to justify the inability of deceased to prevent the accident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">21.     As far as the above factual averments are concerned, petitioners have\n examined 02 witnesses in support of their case. One of the witnesses is PW-3\n Sh. Mool Chand and the other is PW-4 Sh. Yogesh Kumar @ Yogender. Both\n these witnesses are stated to have been available at the spot of accident, being\n the occupants of the offending vehicle which was stopped owing to a punctured\n tyre. Firstly, we may take up the testimony of PW-4. PW4 deposed through his\n affidavit Ex. PW4/A that on the relevant date he was travelling in the offending\n vehicle alongwith his family (including PW3).                 He further deposed that near\n Madhuban, one of the tyres of the offending vehicle was punctured and the\n offending vehicle was parked along the central Patri (verge) by R-1 for replacing\n the punctured tyre despite objections by PW3 as well as himself. He further\n deposed that the road was not lit nor did R1 put on the lights/ flashers of the\n offending vehicle. After sometime the accidental car came from behind, and\n having noticed the parked offending vehicle it (accidental car) tried to steer\n towards left side of the road but in this process struck against the offending\n vehicle and its driver (deceased) sustained fatal injuries. This witness\n                                                                  LOVLEEN\n                                                                          was not  Digitally signed\n                                                                                   by LOVLEEN\n                                                                                   Date:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                                                                                   2020.12.01\n                                                                                   17:48:52 +0530\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">MACT Case No. 356688/16   Usha Goel Vs   Chetan Sharma &amp; Ors              Page No. 9 /43</span>\n  cross-examined by R-1 and R-2. This witness was subjected to a brief cross\n examination by R3 wherein he admitted that he could not read English and that\n he could not tell what is written in his affidavit Ex. PW4/A. The affidavit of PW4\n has been prepared in English language and apparently PW4 is not aware about\n its contents. The petitioners did not take any steps to salvage the situation and\n as such, this Tribunal is constrained to reject all the factual assertions made by\n PW4               in           his              affidavit       Ex.               PW4/A.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\"> 22.    Now, we are left with the oral testimony of other eye witness namely Sh.\n Mool Chand, who has been examined as PW-3. PW-3 is the person who was\n travelling in the offending vehicle alongwith his family. PW-3 deposed before this\n Tribunal that R-1 was the driver of the offending vehicle and about 2 KM before\n Madhuban, one of the tyres of the offending vehicle was punctured. PW-3 further\n deposed that the offending vehicle was parked adjoining the central verge by R-1\n for changing the punctured tyre. PW-3 further deposed that one car came from\n behind and hit the offending vehicle. PW-3 further deposed that there was no\n light on the road, however, tail lights of offending vehicle were &quot;on&quot;. PW-3 further\n deposed that the driver of the car died on the spot after the impact. PW-3 further\n deposed that the time of incident was about 2:30 - 3:00 am.              PW-3 further\n deposed that he got one FIR registered, copy of which is Ex. PW1/1. PW-3 was\n cross-examined briefly only by R-3 as R-1 and R-2 remained ex-parte\n throughout. Perusal of the cross-examination of PW-3 on behalf of R-3 does not\n reveal any suggestion contrary to the above factual assertions (of PW-3). The\n above mentioned factual assertions of PW-3 have practically gone unrebutted.\n These factual assertions are largely in line with facts mentioned in FIR Ex.\n PW1/1, which was also recorded at the instance of PW3.                  The copies of\n mechanical inspection reports of the offending vehicle as well as the accidental\n car which are Ex. PW1/3 and Ex. PW1/4 respectively are also corroborative of\n the factual assertions of PW3. In fact it is not disputed that R1 was prosecuted\n by the police/ state, vide a charge sheet, for the commission ofDigitally\n                                                                 byoffences\n                                                                    LOVLEEN\n                                                                           signed\n                                                                                  U/s\n                                                               LOVLEEN   Date: 2020.12.01\n                                                                         17:49:01 +0530\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">MACT Case No. 356688/16   Usha Goel Vs   Chetan Sharma &amp; Ors       Page No. 10 /43</span>\n  283/304A <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">IPC</a>. A copy of postmortem report Ex. PW1/2 of deceased is also\n corroborative of the above factual assertions. Besides the above, R-1 himself\n was the best witness who could have stepped into the witness box to challenge\n the depositions being made by PW3 regarding the above accident and its\n manner etc., but he has not done so. Respondents have not lead any evidence\n to contradict the oral testimony of PW3. In the conspired opinion of this Tribunal\n the oral testimony of PW3 is reliable and worth acting upon. Therefore, now this\n tribunal proceeds to assess the effect of oral testimony of PW3 on the merits of\n petitioners&#x27; case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">                Parking of Offending Vehicle in the Middle of road\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"> 23.    The case of the petitioners is that R-1 wrongly parked the offending vehicle\n in the middle of the road and which act of R-1 is the proximate cause of accident.\n Firstly we may assess as to whether the plea of petitioners to the effect that R-1\n parked offending vehicle in the middle of the road is established or not. We may\n observe here that PW3 Sh. Mool Chand has stated in the FIR Ex. PW1/1 that the\n offending vehicle was parked in the middle of the road by R-1 for the purpose of\n changing a punctured tyre. PW3 has stated before this Tribunal that the\n offending vehicle was parked by R-1 at a spot adjoining the central verge of the\n road for the purpose of changing the punctured tyre. As such, PW3 has\n corroborated the claim of the petitioners that the offending vehicle was parked on\n the road itself by R1 at the relevant time and not on the side of the road, as\n claimed by R3 in its pleadings. By not leading any evidence to the contrary, R3\n has allowed the above factual assertions of PW3 to go unrebutted. In these\n circumstances, this Tribunal is supposed to decide as to whether or not the act\n and conduct of R1 was negligent. In this regard it would be appropriate to refer to\n <a href=\"/doc/497562/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 122</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1870612/\" id=\"a_10\">126</a> of the Act.

As such, R-1 acted in gross violation of the rules governing the use\n of offending vehicle on a public road, more particularly on a highway. Such a\n misconduct of R-1, that too on an unlit stretch of a highway, is nothing but gross\n negligence and default. This Tribunal feels that this misconduct of R-1 needs to\n be kept in mind while deciding the cause of the present accident. Now this\n Tribunal proceeds to deal with the other factual averments of petitioners as well\n as the evidence regarding the cause of accident.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">                                   Cause of Accident\n\n\n\n\n                                                         Digitally\n                                                         signed by\n                                                         LOVLEEN\n                                                 LOVLEEN Date:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">                                                         2020.12.01\n                                                         17:49:29\n                                                         +0530\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">MACT Case No. 356688/16   Usha Goel Vs   Chetan Sharma &amp; Ors     Page No. 14 /43</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\"> 24. The petitioners have pleaded that at the relevant time the deceased, in order\n to give way to other vehicles coming at fast speed from behind, moved the\n accidental car slightly to his right and all of a sudden dashed against the\n offending vehicle. Again we have to turn to oral testimony of eye witness PW3\n Sh. Mool Chand. PW3 Mool Chand deposed nothing before this Tribunal\n regarding the attempt allegedly made by the deceased to give way to vehicles\n coming from behind and subsequently dashing against the wrongly parked\n offending vehicle. The only aspect in which PW3 has supported the averments\n of petitioners is the fact that the offending vehicle was parked by R-1 adjoining\n the central verge of the road and accidental car dashed against the offending\n vehicle. Rather at one place, PW3 has suggested that the deceased was not\n careful while driving the accidental car. He does show by deposing that the tail\n lights of the offending vehicle were &quot;on&quot;. It may be observed here that the\n petitioners did not bother to challenge/ cross-examine the oral testimony of PW3\n when he deposed that the tail lights of the offending vehicle were &quot;on&quot;. The\n effect of this failure on the part of petitioners shall be dealt with later on in this\n judgment. At this juncture, it would be appropriate to confine ourselves to the\n aspect of cause of accident as felt by PW3. At the cost of repetition, we may\n observe here that PW3 is silent as to what caused the deceased to dash against\n the wrongly parked offending vehicle. In this respect, we may refer to the FIR Ex.\n PW1/1 as the said document is relied by petitioners. In the FIR, PW3 has stated\n clearly and categorically that due to wrong parking of offending vehicle by R-1,\n the traffic was getting obstructed. As per FIR, the driver of accidental car, when\n the accidental car reached near the offending vehicle, was blinded by the\n headlights of the vehicles coming from the opposite direction due to which the\n accidental car dashed into the parked offending vehicle. This fact is contrary to\n the pleadings of petitioners but the petitioners did not bother to question/ cross\n examine PW3 in this regard. Moreover the petitioners chose to remain silent\n when PW3 failed to state the cause of accident during this enquiry. Petitioners\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                                         Digitally signed by</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                                                         LOVLEEN</span>\n                                                               LOVLEEN   Date: 2020.12.01\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                                         17:49:36 +0530</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">MACT Case No. 356688/16   Usha Goel Vs   Chetan Sharma &amp; Ors         Page No. 15 /43</span>\n  did not raise any query to elicit a response from PW3 in this regard for unknown\n reasons. No other material has been placed on record by petitioners in order to\n substantiate their plea as to cause of accident. As such, it could be safely held\n that the averment of the petitioners to the effect &quot;that the deceased, in order to\n give way to other vehicles coming at fast speed from behind, moved the\n accidental car slightly to his right and all of a sudden, struck the offending\n vehicle&quot; remains not proved. Rather, a new and unchallenged fact has come on\n record from the oral testimony of PW3- &quot;that tail lights of offending vehicle were\n on at the time of accident&quot;. The effect of this new fact on the final decision of this\n case is discussed below.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">25. Having come across a new fact, this tribunal must decide its effect on the\n merits of this case. Admittedly, this new fact &quot;that tail lights of offending vehicle\n were on at the time of accident&quot; has come on record for the first time only during\n the course of this enquiry (i.e. at the time of recording of oral testimony of PW3).\n Admittedly, no such thing is mentioned in the FIR Ex PW1/1 (i.e. the first\n document which records the occurrence of the accident), which was also\n recorded at the instance of PW3. Although Ld. Counsel for petitioners have\n urged this tribunal to discard this new fact on the ground that no such statement\n was made by PW3 at the time of recording of FIR, however he is at a loss of\n words to explain as to why this particular piece of statement was not challenged\n by way of cross-examination by petitioners at the relevant time. Admittedly, an\n FIR is not an encyclopaedia of facts. If an eyewitness deposes some additional\n facts subsequently and the affected party fails to rebut or challenge the additional\n facts deposed by said witness, then the party shall have to bear the\n consequences of their own omission. As such, this Tribunal finds no reason to\n discard this additional fact. Hence, it could be safely assumed that the tail lights\n of the offending vehicle were &quot;on&quot; at the relevant time.                 Digitally\n                                                                          signed by\n                                                                          LOVLEEN\n                                                               LOVLEEN    Date:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">                                                                          2020.12.01\n                                                                          17:49:43\n                                                                          +0530\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">MACT Case No. 356688/16   Usha Goel Vs   Chetan Sharma &amp; Ors       Page No. 16 /43</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\"> 26.     So, now we have two facts which have been proved by the petitioners to\n the satisfaction of this tribunal- (i) that the offending vehicle was wrongly parked\n in the middle of the road by R-1, and (ii) that tail lights of the offending vehicle\n were &quot;on&quot;. Liability of respondents is to be decided on the basis of these facts.\n This tribunal has already held in the afore going paragraphs that R-1 failed to\n comply with the duties imposed by law by choosing to park offending vehicle in\n the middle of road and has exposed himself to all the consequential penalties.\n Although tail lights of the offending vehicle were &quot;on&quot; at the relevant time but in\n the considered opinion of this Tribunal, the same does not absolve R-1 of his\n liability completely. Merely by leaving tail lights on while parking the offending\n vehicle in the middle of the road, R-1 did not fulfill his duty to avoid danger/\n obstruction or undue inconvenience to his fellow road users; particularly when\n the relevant stretch of the road was not lit (PW3 deposed before this Tribunal\n that there was no light on the road). It would be highly unreasonable to expect\n from a driver of a vehicle going on a highway, where the permitted speed limits\n are always higher than the permitted speed limits in urban/ residential areas or\n city limits, to gauge and assess perfectly from 1-2 small red colour lamps (tail\n lights) as to whether the vehicle in front is moving or is stationary, particularly\n when the road is not lit. But at the same time, the law does not encourage such\n a driver, even though driving on an unlit road, to totally disregard any glowing tail\n lamps visible in the distance and to keep driving in the same lane without getting\n cautious and then dash his vehicle in the said tail lamps. The accident occurred\n at 3:00 AM, so it could be assumed that traffic load would not be much at the\n relevant time. But still the deceased dashed the accidental car into the offending\n vehicle with such a speed that the offending vehicle jumped across the central\n verge, despite a punctured tyre, onto the opposite carriageway of road and then\n fell into a ditch. This fact speaks volumes about the excessively high speed at\n which the accidental car was being driven by the deceased at the relevant time.\n Moreover, the very fact that deceased failed to take evasive action till the last\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                                                         Digitally signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                                         by LOVLEEN</span>\n                                                               LOVLEEN   Date: 2020.12.01\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                                                         17:49:49 +0530</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">MACT Case No. 356688/16   Usha Goel Vs   Chetan Sharma &amp; Ors      Page No. 17 /43</span>\n  moment despite seeing a wrongly parked vehicle with glowing tail lamps betrays\n his own negligence as well, particularly when there is no plea regarding any\n mechanical defect in the accidental car. Here this tribunal finds it appropriate to\n hold that in the given circumstances the misconduct of R-1 in parking the\n offending vehicle in the middle of road is the proximate cause of action.\n However the inaction of deceased also contributed to the accident as well as its\n disastrous consequences. Since the present one is clearly a case of contributory\n negligence, therefore it requires severance of compensation to the extent for\n which the deceased was responsible for the accident.                <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"74668737\" id=\"span_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77569266\" id=\"span_37\">In this regard, this\n Tribunal relies upon the observations made by Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/77569266/\" id=\"a_11\">Pawan\n Kumar and Ors.

Although this Tribunal entertained doubts about\n considering these documents without any oral evidence regarding identification\n of handwriting/ signatures on them, particularly in the absence of originals,\n however, in view of the fact that Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has chosen to rely upon\n similar documents in <a href=\"/doc/76484045/\" id=\"a_16\">Sangita Arya &amp; Ors.

Apparently, this Tribunal has before it (i) oral testimony (of PW1 and PW2)\n regarding the alleged sources of income of deceased and (ii)documentary\n materials (being the copies of IT Returns) regarding the income of the deceased\n from the above sources. There is no reason to discard the individual IT Returns\n of deceased. However, a closer scrutiny of the records reveals that except for\n oral testimony of PW1 and PW2, there is no material on record which depicts\n that the deceased was a partner in the firm Grand Links International. It is not\n disputed that the firm Grand Links International was reconstituted vide a Deed\n Ex. PW2/DA, allegedly after the death of the deceased, however, the petitioners\n have failed to place on record the original partnership deed which could have\n assisted and corroborated the claim of the petitioners that the deceased was a\n partner in the firm Grand Links International. Reason for holding back this\n document is unknown and an adverse view has to be taken against the\n petitioners. Even if this aspect is ignored, still the claim of the petitioners as to\n the income of the deceased to the tune of Rs. 1,42,60,782/- stands on a very\n weak footing. As per the IT Returns of firm Grand Link International Ex. PW6/1\n to PW6/3 and Ex. PW5/1 (Ex. PW5/2 is not traceable in the judicial file), the\n income of the firm stood at Rs. 1,94,84,973/- (year 1998-99), Rs. 3,03,94,457/-\n (year 1999-2000), Rs. 5,51,93,337/- (year 2000-01) and Rs. 3,58,61,655/- (year\n 2001-02) respectively. It is claimed by the petitioners that deceased was a\n partner in the firm Grand Link International and was having a share of 25% in the\n said income of the said firm. So, looking at the above income of firm Grand Link\n International, we should reasonably expect the income of deceased to be also\n quite high. However, the individual IT Returns of the deceased pertaining to\n assessment years 1998-1999, 1999-2000, 2000-2001 &amp; 2001-2002 which are\n Ex. PW4/A to PW4/D respectively do not reflect any income from the firm Grand\n Links International. This infirmity could not be ignored, particularly in the absence\n of any documentary record which reflect that the deceased was a partner in the\n firm Grand Links International or was having any income to the tune of Rs.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                                           Digitally signed by</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                                                           LOVLEEN</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">                                                               LOVLEEN     Date: 2020.12.01\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                                                           17:50:38 +0530</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">MACT Case No. 356688/16   Usha Goel Vs   Chetan Sharma &amp; Ors      Page No. 23 /43</span>\n  1,42,60,782/- during any time between the financial years 1998 to 2002.\n Although the Ld. Counsel for the petitioners has tried to wriggle out of this\n unfavourable predicament by referring to a statement made by PW2 during\n cross-examination to the effect - &#x27;that the earnings of the firm Grand Links\n International were transferred to the &quot;Capital Account&quot; of each partner&#x27;, however,\n this argument could not be upheld as the internal accounting practice of the said\n firm would not absolve the deceased from his legal liability to furnish income\n details from all his sources in his personal IT Returns. Moreover, this argument\n that the income of the firm Grand Links International was transferred to the\n &quot;Capital Account&quot; of each partner has not been corroborated by any document.\n If the said sum falling in the capital account of deceased was &#x27;income&#x27; then there\n is no reason why the said amount should not be reflected in the individual IT\n Returns of deceased. In the considered opinion of this tribunal, whether or not\n such income of deceased was exempt from tax, still it was required to be\n disclosed in the individual IT returns of deceased. It is apparent from the records\n that copies of receipted Saral Forms pertaining to firm Grand Links International\n Ex. PW6/1 to PW6/3 and Ex. PW5/1 do not reflect any connection of deceased\n with the said firm and apart from those documents the only material relied on by\n the petitioners to claim that the deceased was having any income from the firm\n Grand Links International is the oral testimony of PW1 and PW2. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1964308\" id=\"span_57\">In view of the\n observations made by Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court at para 9 in <a href=\"/doc/1964308/\" id=\"a_18\">The Oriental\n Insurance Company Limited vs Meena Variyal MANU/SC/7265/2007</a>, this\n Tribunal could not act upon such a bald testimony of PW1 and PW2.\n Accordingly, this Tribunal is unable to hold that the deceased was having any\n income from the firm Grand Links International at or before his death.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">                                                             Digitally\n                                                             signed by\n                                                             LOVLEEN\n                                                     LOVLEEN Date:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">                                                             2020.12.01\n                                                             17:50:44\n                                                             +0530\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">MACT Case No. 356688/16   Usha Goel Vs   Chetan Sharma &amp; Ors         Page No. 24 /43</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\"> 36.
