Briefly stated the case of the petitioners is as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">         That on 03.09.2019, at about 07.45 p.m., while the\n\ndeceased was a pillion rider on a Motorcycle bearing\n\nregistration No.AP-39-SV-9869 along with a rider           from\n\nValmiki circle to their house and when they reached near\n\nOld Karnataka Bank, Madakashira town, at that time, the\n\ndriver of Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Reg. No.KA-02-\n\nAG-1786 came from behind and dashed to the Motorcycle\n\nof the deceased in which he was a pillion. Due to the\n\nimpact, the deceased fell down and sustained grievous\n\ninjuries . He took treatment in Madakashira Government\n\nhospital, Hindupur Government hospital and NIMHANS,\n\nbut on 05.09.2019 deceased succumbed to the injuries in\n\nNIMHANS hospital.          A case was registered against the\n\ndriver of the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Reg. No.KA-\n\n02-AG-1786 in Crime No.136/2019 at Madakashira Police\n\nStation. Hence, this petition for compensation.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> SCCH-1               4                MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">     3. In response to the notice, the respondent No.1 has\n\nremained absent and hence, he was placed exparte.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">     The respondent No.2 has appeared before the Court\n\nthrough its Counsel and has filed written statement by\n\ndenying the   petition averments as false. The respondent\n\nNo.2 had issued a commercial vehicle package policy\n\nbearing No.015917637600 to Maruthi Swift Dzire Car\n\nbearing Reg. No.KA-02-AG-1786 and the same was valid as\n\non the date of accident and the liability is subject to the\n\nterms and conditions of the policy. A false complaint has\n\nbeen lodged against the insured vehicle after the lapse of 3\n\ndays of the alleged accident by twisting the facts by\n\ncolluding with the respondent No.1 and concerned persons\n\nin order to get wrongful gain. The petition is bad for non-\n\njoinder of necessary parties such as owner and insurer of\n\nthe motorcycle. The insured vehicle had no valid permit to\n\nply on the alleged accident spot and the driver had no\n\ndriving licence as on the date of accident and the same\n\namounts to violation of policy conditions.         The first\n\nrespondent    has   not   complied   with   the   mandatory\n\nrequirements of <a href=\"/doc/734786/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 134(c)</a> of M.V.Act and Police have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> SCCH-1                5                MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nnot complied the mandatory requirements of <a href=\"/doc/74970700/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 158(6)</a>\n\nof M.V.Act. Hence, prays to dismiss the petition.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">     5. On the basis of the above pleadings, this Court has\n\nframed the following issues:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">         1. Whether the petitioners prove that the deceased\n            succumbed to injuries in a Motor Vehicle\n            Accident that occurred on 03.09.2019 at about\n            7.45 p.m. at Madakashira, Near N.T.R., Circle,\n            Ananthapur District, Andhra Pradesh, within\n            the jurisdiction of Madkashira Police Station on\n            account of rash and negligent driving of the\n            Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration\n            No.KA-02-AG-1786 by its driver when the\n            deceased was proceeding as pillion rider in the\n            Hero Glamour two wheeler bearing Reg.

Whether  the petitioners are entitled for\n            compensation? If so, how much and from\n            whom?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">         3. What order ?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">     6. On behalf of the petitioners, the first petitioner is\n\nexamined as PW-1 and got marked Exs.P.1 to P.19. On the\n\nother hand, the second respondent has examined its\n\nofficial as RW.1 and also examined three witnesses as RWs\n\n2 to 4 and got marked documents as Exs.R.1 to R.11.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">     7.

As per final order\n                   for the following:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                          REASONS\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">     9. Issue No.1 :- The petitioners in order to prove this\n\nissue are relying upon the oral evidence of PW.1 and also\n\ndocumentary evidence as per Exs.P.1 to P.6 such as FIR,\n\ncomplaint, chargesheet, PM Report, Inquest Mahazar and\n\nsketch.   PW.1 in his affidavit evidence has narrated the\n\nmanner in which his father met with an accident and\n\naccident was due to the rash and negligent act on the part\n\nof the driver of the Swift Car bearing registration No.KA-02-\n\nAG-1786. The first respondent being the owner of the said\n\ncar has remained exparte.    The second respondent being\n\nthe insured of the said car has filed the written statement\n\ndenying the involvement of the insured car itself in the\n\nalleged accident by contending that a false complaint has\n\nbeen lodged against the insured vehicle after the lapse of\n\nthree days of alleged accident in collusion.    The second\n\nrespondent is relying upon the evidence of its official as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\"> SCCH-1                7               MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nRW.1 and also three witnesses who are the Superintendent\n\nof RTO, Medical Record Officer of NIMHANS Hospital and\n\nInvestigating Officer as RWs 2 to 4. The second respondent\n\nis also relying upon the IMV report, MLC extract, seizure\n\npanchanama and statement of eye-witness as per Ex.R.4,\n\nR.8, R.10 and R.11. Let us consider the evidence placed by\n\nthe parties to decide this issue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">     10. PW.1 is the son of the deceased Sriramulu and\n\nadmittedly, he has not seen the accident.         Even the\n\npetitioners have not examined any eye-witness to the\n\naccident.    They are mainly relying upon the police\n\ndocuments to prove this issue.          As per PW.1, on\n\n03.09.2019 at about 7.45 p.m., when his father was a\n\npillion rider on a motorcycle bearing registration No.AP-39-\n\nAV-9869 ridden by his brother-in-law on the extreme left\n\nside of the road and when they reached near NTR circle, at\n\nthat time, a Swift car bearing registration No.KA-02-AG-\n\n1786 driven by its driver at high speed and in a rash and\n\nnegligent manner, suddenly came and dashed against the\n\nmotorcycle from behind and due to the impact, his father\n\nfell down and sustained grievous injuries and though he\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\"> SCCH-1               8                MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nwas shifted to Madakashira Government Hospital and then\n\nto Hindupura Government Hospital and then to NIMHANS,\n\nBengaluru,    but   he   succumbed   to   the   injuries   on\n\n05.09.2019.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">     11. FIR and the complaint as per Exs.P.1 and P.2\n\ndisclose that on the basis of the complaint lodged by one\n\nH.Naresh, a criminal case was registered against the driver\n\nof an unknown car. Accident occurred on 03.09.2019, but\n\nthe complaint was lodged on 06.09.2019. Thus, there is\n\ndelay of three days in lodging the complaint. Ex.P.2(a) is\n\nthe translation of Ex.P.2, wherein the complainant has\n\nstated that as the deceased was taking treatment in\n\nNIMHANS hospital and as he succumbed to the injuries on\n\n05.09.2019, on the next day i.e., on 06.09.2019 he has\n\nlodged the complaint to the police. Even PW.1 in his cross-\n\nexamination has deposed that immediately after the\n\naccident, as he was in the hospital, there was delay in\n\nlodging the complaint. He has also deposed that as all the\n\nrelatives were concentrating on the health of the deceased,\n\nNaresh also could not lodge the complaint immediately.\n\nThe complainant is no other than the rider of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\"> SCCH-1                   9                 MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nmotorcycle in which the deceased was a pillion rider. The\n\ncomplainant is the son-in-law of the deceased. As such, it\n\ncan be said that the complainant was with the deceased at\n\nthe time of accident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">       12.   The     contents   of   complaint    disclose   that\n\nimmediately after the accident, the complainant and others\n\nhave     shifted   the   deceased    to   Government   Hospital,\n\nMadakashira and then the deceased was shifted to\n\nGovernment Hospital, Hindupura and then the deceased\n\nwas referred to NIMHANS Hospital, Bengaluru.                 That\n\nmeans, after the accident, all along the complainant was\n\nwith the deceased and as such, even he was not able to\n\nlodge the complaint.         Hence, by considering that the\n\ncomplainant and other family members of the deceased\n\nwere engaged in providing treatment to the deceased after\n\nthe accident, they were not able to lodge the complaint on\n\nthe date of accident. The family members of the deceased\n\nhave given much priority to the treatment of the deceased\n\nrather than to visit the police station to lodge the\n\ncomplaint.         As such, the reasons assigned by the\n\ncomplainant enables the court to hold that there was delay\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> SCCH-1                10                 MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nin lodging the complaint on account of providing treatment\n\nto the deceased and only after the death of the deceased,\n\ncomplaint was lodged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">      13. The sketch-Ex.P.6 reveals the state of affairs at\n\nthe accident spot. As per Ex.P.6, the place of accident is\n\non the left side of Madhugiri-Hindupura road. The police\n\ndocuments disclose that on the date of accident, the\n\ndeceased and the rider of the motorcycle were moving from\n\nthe   side   of   Hindupura    towards   Madhugiri   and   at\n\nMadakashira, accident has occurred.          Though in the\n\nsketch-Ex.P.6, the movement of the vehicles involved in the\n\naccident is not shown, but, from the contents of the\n\ncomplaint and the chargesheet, it can be said that both the\n\nmotorcycle and the car in question were moving in the\n\nsame direction.     As per PW.1 and the complainant, the\n\ndriver of an unknown car has hit the motorcycle from\n\nbehind without blowing the horn. Thus, Ex.P.6 supports\n\nthe case of the petitioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">      14. PM Report and the Inquest mahazar as per\n\nExs.P.4 and P.5 disclose that the death of the deceased\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\"> SCCH-1               11                MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nwas due to severe traumatic brain injury causing cardiac\n\nrespiratory arrest. These documents clearly establish that\n\nthe death of the deceased was caused on account of severe\n\ntraumatic brain injury. At the time of preparing the sketch\n\nand also at the time of postmortem of the dead body and\n\ninquest mahazar, the number of the car which caused the\n\naccident to the deceased, was not yet known, since the\n\nInvestigation in this regard was under progress.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">       15. On perusal of the complaint, it is noticed that\n\nthe colour and type of the vehicle which caused accident to\n\nthe deceased is mentioned in it, but its number is not\n\nmentioned.    As per the complainant, the vehicle which\n\ncaused the accident to his motorcycle was a white colour\n\ncar.   According to the complainant, the driver of the car\n\nfled away from the spot without stopping the car.        Such\n\nbeing the case, it can be said that it was not possible for\n\nthe complainant to note down the number of the car which\n\ncaused accident. Moreover, the car which was moving on\n\nthe back side of the motorcycle of the complainant has hit\n\nthe motorcycle from back side. As such, the complainant\n\nwas not able to see the number of the car even earlier to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\"> SCCH-1                12                MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe accident. The official of the second respondent who is\n\nexamined as RW.1 has deposed that a false case has been\n\nfiled in collusion after the lapse of three days of accident\n\nand the insured car has been implicated in collusion\n\nillegally and high handedly after the lapse of three months\n\nafter the accident for wrongful gain.   RW.1 in his cross-\n\nexamination has admitted that he has given evidence on\n\nthe basis of the records, but he has no personal knowledge\n\nabout the accident. He also admits that on completion of\n\ninvestigation, chargesheet is filed against the driver of the\n\ninsured vehicle. But, according to RW.1, in the FIR there\n\nis no reference regarding the insured vehicle.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">     16. The second respondent has also summoned the\n\nMedical Record Officer     of NIMHANS hospital and he is\n\nexamined as RW.3 and he has produced MLC extract and\n\nthe case sheet as per Exs.R.8 and R.9.       In Ex.R.8, the\n\nhistory of RTA is shown as &quot;Bike hit by car from behind on\n\n03.09.2019 at 7.30 p.m., at Madakashira&quot;. Even in MLC\n\nextract-Ex.R.8, the number of the car which hit the bike is\n\nnot mentioned.    However, from Ex.R.8, it is clear that\n\nimmediately after the accident, the deceased was shifted to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\"> SCCH-1               13                 MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nGovernment     Hospital,   Madakashira      and    then     to\n\nGovernment Hospital, Hindupura and from that hospital,\n\nthe deceased was referred to NIMHANS Hospital. As the\n\ndeceased was admitted to NIMHANS hospital for treatment\n\nafter the accident, it can be said that the reason assigned\n\nby the petitioners for delay in lodging the complaint has to\n\nbe accepted as genuine reason.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">     17. PW.1 in his cross-examination has admitted that\n\nin the complaint it is mentioned that &#x27;dashed by unknown\n\nvehicle&#x27;. He has also deposed that he has not given any\n\nfurther statement mentioning      the number      of the car\n\nwhich caused the accident. Except these versions of PW.1\n\nin the cross-examination, nothing worth is elicited from his\n\nmouth regarding the false implication of the insured car in\n\naccident by the petitioners in collusion with the police and\n\nthe owner. Merely because in the complaint and also in\n\nthe MLC extract, the number of the car which caused\n\naccident is not mentioned, whether the false implication of\n\nthe insured car as contended by the second respondent\n\ncan be inferred or not is the point to be considered now.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\"> SCCH-1               14                MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">     18. In order to decide the said point, the evidence of\n\nRW.4 and documents such as seizure panchanama and\n\nstatement of witness at Exs.R.10 and R.11 assumes much\n\nimportance.   RW.4 is the Investigating Officer who was\n\nsummoned by the second respondent counsel. As per the\n\nevidence of RW.4, he has verified the investigation made by\n\nan earlier Investigation Officer i.e., HC-2131-Muthyalanna\n\nand then he filed chargesheet against the driver of the car\n\nbearing registration No.KA-02-AG-1786.       He has also\n\ndeposed that during the investigation conducted by an\n\nearlier Investigating Officer, statement of one eye-witness\n\nby name A.Lakshminarasappa/LW.6 was recorded and as\n\nper the statement of eye-witness, the number of the vehicle\n\nwhich caused the accident was got known. Thus, from the\n\nevidence of RW.4, it is evident that chargesheet was filed\n\nby RW.4 on the basis of the statement given by an eye-\n\nwitness A.Lakshminarasappa against the driver of the car\n\nbearing registration No.KA-02-AG-1786. This witness was\n\ntreated as hostile by the second respondent counsel and he\n\nwas cross-examined by the said counsel. During his cross-\n\nexamination, RW.4 has produced seizure panchanama and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\"> SCCH-1                   15                 MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nstatement of LW.6 as per Ex.R.10 and R.11. RW.4 in his\n\ncross-examination has deposed that earlier Investigation\n\nOfficer   has   seized    Maruti    Swift   Dzire   car   bearing\n\nregistration No.KA-02-AG-1786 under Ex.R.10 and its\n\ntranslation is at Ex.R.10(a). Even he has deposed that as\n\nper Ex.R.10, after receipt of the notice by the Investigating\n\nOfficer, the vehicle was produced by the driver and at that\n\ntime, the driver was arrested.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">      19. Ex.R.11 and R.11(a)        is the statement of LW.6-\n\nA.Lakshminarasappa and translation of Ex.R.11.                The\n\npolice mainly on the basis of Ex.R.11 have come to the\n\nconclusion regarding the registration number of the car\n\nwhich caused accident to the deceased.              RW.4 in his\n\ncross-examination has deposed that as per the statement\n\nof LW.6, he is the native of Rekulakunta village and\n\ndeceased also belongs to Rekulakunta village, but he used\n\nto stay at Madakashira.            RW.4 has denied that the\n\ncomplainant and LW.6 are relatives as per the averments\n\nin the complaint. But, nowhere in the complaint, the\n\ncomplainant has stated the name of LW.6 and the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> SCCH-1               16                 MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nrelationship between him and LW.6.             As such, this\n\nsuggestion made to RW.4 regarding the relationship of\n\ncomplainant and LW.6 cannot be believed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">       20. RW.4 has also denied that only to implicate the\n\ninsured vehicle, statement of LW.6 was created and if LW.6\n\nwas an eye-witness to the accident, he would have\n\nimmediately informed about the involvement of the vehicle.\n\nIt is noticed that Ex.R.11 is dated 08.09.2019.            That\n\nmeans, after the lapse of five days of the accident, the\n\nstatement of eye-witness/LW.6-A. Lakshminarasappa was\n\nrecorded by an earlier Investigating Officer. Ex.P.11(a) is a\n\ncase     diary   dated    08.09.2019   which    contains    the\n\ntranslation of Ex.R.11. As per the contents of Ex.R.11(a),\n\non the date of accident, LW.6 came to his village\n\nRekalakunta and after taking store rice, at about 6.30pm.,\n\nhe left his village in an auto with an intention to go to\n\nBengaluru and came to Madakashira town at about 7.40\n\np.m., and he was waiting near Madhugiri circle and at that\n\ntime, one white colour car came from Pavagada side in a\n\nrash and negligent manner at high speed and dashed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> SCCH-1                17                MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nagainst the motorcycle from back side and as a result, the\n\nrider and pillion rider fell down and though the driver of\n\nthe car slowed down the car, but on observing the\n\ngathering of the mob who tried to stop the car, he fled away\n\nfrom the spot along with the car without stopping due to\n\nfear and he also tried to stop the car and observed the\n\nregistration number of the car and its driver.       Though\n\nEx.R.11(a) discloses that the deceased and LW.6 are from\n\nthe same village, but they are not relatives as suggested to\n\nRW.4. LW.6 in his statement has also stated that he has\n\nnoted down the registration number of the car as KA-02-\n\nAG-1786 in a white paper chit and he can identify the\n\ndriver.   RW.4 in his cross-examination has deposed that\n\nan earlier Investigating Officer has not recorded the further\n\nstatement of LW.6 and even he or an earlier Investigating\n\nOfficer have not recorded the further statement of the\n\ncomplainant after identifying the vehicle. Merely because,\n\nearlier Investigating Officer or RW.4 have not recorded the\n\nfurther statement of LW.6 and the complainant, whether\n\nEx.R.11 can be disbelieved is the point to be considered\n\nnow.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\"> SCCH-1                 18                MVC No.104/2020</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_35\">      21.   In    Ex.R.11(a),   LW.6   has     stated    that   on\n\n08.09.2019 he came to his village and at that time, he met\n\nPW.1 and when he enquired about the health condition of\n\nthe deceased, he came to know that the deceased died due\n\nto accidental injuries and at that time, he informed PW.1\n\nabout the registration number of the car which caused the\n\naccident to the deceased and he came to the police station\n\nand informed the registration number of the car to the\n\npolice.     Ex.R.11     is   the   statement     given    by    an\n\neye-witness/LW.6 before an earlier Investigating Officer on\n\n08.09.2019.      Except making suggestions to RW.4 by the\n\nsecond respondent counsel, he has not chosen to summon\n\nthe driver or the owner of the car in question to prove that\n\nthe insured car was not at all involved in the accident, but\n\nit has been falsely implicated by the petitioners in collusion\n\nwith the police. In the absence of the evidence of the driver\n\nor the owner of the insured car, the statement of LW.6 as\n\nper Exs.R.11 and R.11(a) assumes much importance, since\n\non the basis of the said statement, further investigation\n\nwas conducted by the police by seizing the insured car\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\"> SCCH-1                19                MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nunder seizure panchanama as per Ex.R.1- and then filing\n\nchargesheet against the driver of the said car.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">     22. Though PW.1 in his cross-examination has\n\ndeposed that there is no impediment for him to adduce the\n\nevidence of eye-witness to the accident, but he has not\n\nchosen to summon the said eye-witness. Even the second\n\nrespondent except summoning RW.4, has not chosen to\n\nsummon LW.6-A.Lakshminarasappa, to disprove the case\n\nput forth by the petitioners. As such, only on the available\n\nmaterials on record, this court has to arrive at a conclusion\n\nregarding the involvement of the insured vehicle in the\n\naccident or not.    Though RW.4 was summoned by the\n\nsecond respondent, but he has not supported the case of\n\nthe second respondent as to non-involvement of the\n\ninsured car in accident. On the other hand, the evidence\n\nof RW.4 helps the petitioners to prove regarding occurring\n\nof the accident due to the rash and negligent act on the\n\npart of the driver of the car bearing registration No.KA-02-\n\nAG-1786. Even some suggestions were made to RW.4 that\n\neven though he came to      know that as per the hospital\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\"> SCCH-1                   20                      MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nrecords, the deceased was riding the motorcycle, but in\n\norder to help the petitioners, without ascertaining the true\n\nfacts, he has filed the chargesheet by mentioning the\n\ndeceased as a pillion rider. This suggestion was denied by\n\nRW.4.         In support of this suggestion, the second\n\nrespondent is relying upon the evidence of RW.3 and also\n\nthe MLC extract as per Ex.R.8.            In Ex.R.8, though it is\n\nmentioned that at the time of accident, injured was\n\ntravelling in a two wheeler, but subsequently it is\n\nmentioned that the deceased was a rider of the two wheeler\n\nin Column No.8 of Ex.R.8.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">       23. PW.1 in his cross-examination has deposed that\n\nat the time of admitting his father to NIMHANS hospital,\n\nhistory of injury was provided as &#x27;accident occurred while\n\ntravelling in a bike&#x27;.        The same has been mentioned in\n\nColumn No.6 of Ex.R.8. But, while recording the category\n\nof the injured in Column No.8 in Ex.R.8, it is shown that\n\nthe deceased was a two wheeler rider. This entry in Ex.R.8\n\nis contrary to the contents of the complaint-Ex.P.2 and\n\nalso    the   statement       of   eye-witness     at   Ex.R.11    and\n\nEx.R.11(a).    RW.4 in his cross-examination has deposed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\"> SCCH-1                21                 MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nthat he has not verified the MLC of NIMHANS hospital, by\n\nstating that it was the duty of the earlier Investigating\n\nOfficer to verify the initial hospital records. Nowhere in the\n\nwritten statement, the second respondent has contended\n\nthat at the time of accident, the deceased was a rider of the\n\nmotorcycle and not a pillion rider. Even in the evidence of\n\nRW.1, he has not stated that the deceased was a rider of\n\nthe motorcycle on the date of accident and he was not a\n\npillion rider.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">      24. It is noticed that in the written statement and\n\nalso in the evidence of RW.1, the main contention raised by\n\nthe second respondent is regarding non-involvement of the\n\ninsured vehicle in accident and also about the false\n\nimplication of the insured vehicle by the petitioners in\n\ncollusion with the police. Such being the case, only on the\n\nevidence of RW.3, the second respondent now cannot\n\ncontend that the deceased was the rider of the motorcycle\n\non the date of accident when the second respondent has\n\nseriously disputed the involvement of the vehicle in\n\naccident. As the complaint and also the statement of LW.6\n\nat Ex.P.2, P.2(a),   Ex.R.11 and R.11(a) discloses that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\"> SCCH-1                22                 MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\ndeceased was a pillion rider on the motorcycle ridden by\n\nthe complainant as on the date of accident, I am of the\n\nopinion that only on the stray entry in Ex.R.8, it cannot be\n\nsaid that the deceased was the rider of the motorcycle.\n\nMoreover, as stated above, the second respondent has not\n\nchosen to place the evidence of the driver or the owner of\n\nthe insured car to believe its contention. Even the second\n\nrespondent has not chosen to summon the person who has\n\nwritten the contents of Ex.R.8. Therefore, in the absence of\n\nthe evidence of the person who has written Ex.R.8, only on\n\nthe stray entry in Ex.R.8, the suggestions made to RW.4\n\nthat on the date of accident, the deceased was a rider of\n\nthe motorcycle, cannot be believed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">     25.   Ex.R.10 is dated 08.12.2019.      Under Ex.R.10,\n\nthe police have seized the car bearing registration No.KA-\n\n02-AG-1786, by drawing the mahazar when it was traced\n\nout by an earlier Investigating Officer, in front of the house\n\nof C.M. Chandrashekhar at Kalipi Village, Andhra Pradesh\n\nDistrict. Ex.R.10(a) is the translation of Ex.R.10, wherein\n\nit is stated that earlier Investigating Officer i.e., HC-\n\nMuthyalanna had been to Kalipi Village in search of an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\"> SCCH-1                   23                   MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nunknown car and at that time, a person who was cleaning\n\nthe car, made an attempt to run away from the spot after\n\nseeing the police jeep and then that person was caught by\n\nthe police and on enquiry, they came to know that he was\n\nthe driver of the car bearing registration No.KA-02-AG-\n\n1786 as on the date of accident and he had agreed to\n\npurchase the said car from its owner by name Ravi for a\n\nsum      of   Rs.5,31,230/-,    by   giving     an    advance      of\n\nRs.1,00,000/- to the owner and he has obtained the\n\npossession of the vehicle, and on the date of accident,\n\nwhile C.M.Chandrashekhar was driving the car, in order to\n\navoid hit by a lorry which was coming from the opposite\n\ndirection, he has hit the motorcycle from behind. Thus, at\n\nEx.R.10(a), the accused who was the driver of the car\n\nbearing       registration    No.KA-02-AG-1786        has       given\n\nstatement before the police by stating that he has caused\n\nthe accident by driving his car bearing registration No.KA-\n\n02-AG-1786 and by hitting it to the motorcycle.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">      26. PW.1 in his cross-examination has pleaded\n\nignorance as to the seizure of the car by the police.\n\nMoreover, Ex.R.10 discloses that the police have seized the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\"> SCCH-1               24                 MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\ncar in question after three months of the accident, on the\n\nbasis of the registration number furnished by an eye-\n\nwitness in his statement and also after tracing out the car\n\nin question during investigation. Merely because there was\n\ndelay of three months in seizing the insured car, the claim\n\nof the petitioners cannot be doubted since the Investigating\n\nOfficer has seized the car after tracing it during his\n\ninvestigation. Therefore, from Ex.R.10 and R.10(a) also, it\n\ncan be safely held that the driver of the car bearing\n\nregistration No.KA-02-AG-1786 has caused the accident to\n\nthe deceased, resulting in his death.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">     27. RW.1 has produced IMV report as per Ex.R.4. In\n\nEx.R.4, it is shown that no damages were found on the\n\ninsured car. After seizure of the car by the Investigating\n\nOfficer on 08.12.2019 under Ex.R.10, the IMV Inspector\n\nhas inspected the car on 11.12.2019.        Merely because\n\nthere are no damages found on the insured car, it is not\n\npossible to infer non-involvement of the said car in\n\naccident, since the car was inspected after three months of\n\nthe accident and there is possibility of repairing the\n\ndamages caused to the car by the car owner.               The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\"> SCCH-1                25                 MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nchargesheet-Ex.P.3 was filed by RW.4 against the driver of\n\nthe car bearing registration No.KA-02-AG-1786, after\n\ndetailed investigation.    Even in the chargesheet, it is\n\nalleged that due to the rash and negligent act on the part\n\nof the driver of the car bearing registration No.KA-02-AG-\n\n1786, the deceased met with an accident resulting in his\n\ndeath. This chargesheet was not challenged by the driver\n\nof the car in question.    Even the respondents have not\n\nchosen to summon the driver of the car to prove the non-\n\ninvolvement of the said car in accident. The conduct of the\n\ndriver of the car in not challenging the chargesheet itself is\n\nsufficient to draw an adverse inference against him that, as\n\nthe accident took place due to his negligence, he has\n\nremained silent. Therefore, only on the evidence of RW.1,\n\nthe contention of the second respondent cannot be\n\nbelieved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_47\">     28.

His Lordship has observed\n\nthat in the claim petition before the MACT, the standard of\n\nproof is much below than what is required in criminal\n\ncases as well as civil cases and as the enquiry before the\n\nTribunal is a summary enquiry, it does not require strict\n\nproof of evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">     31.

In the present case\n\nalso, the second respondent has not chosen to summon\n\nthe driver of the insured car by taking steps to secure his\n\npresence. In the absence of the evidence of the driver of\n\nthe insured car, I am of the opinion that the investigation\n\nconducted by the Investigating Officers, cannot be doubted\n\nand even the claim of the petitioners cannot be doubted\n\nonly on the basis of the contention of the second\n\nrespondent, which stands unproved. In the said case also,\n\nthe insurance company has taken a contention regarding\n\nnon-involvement of the insured vehicle in accident. In that\n\ncase, the claimants have examined the Investigating Officer\n\nwho filed the chargesheet regarding the involvement of the\n\ninsured vehicle.   In that case also, initially the details of\n\nthe vehicle was not mentioned in the FIR and only during\n\nthe course of investigation, the vehicle had been identified\n\nand chargesheet had been filed.

I have gone through the Judgments relied upon\n\nby the second respondent counsel, but they are not\n\napplicable to the facts and circumstances of the present\n\ncase.    In the Judgment at Sl.No.1, the alleged offending\n\nvehicle was produced before the police voluntarily by the\n\nyounger brother of the deceased. As such, His Lordship\n\nhas taken the view that insured vehicle was falsely\n\nimplicated by the claimants to claim compensation by\n\nimplicating the vehicle of their close relative. But, in the\n\npresent case, the police have seized the offending vehicle\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\"> SCCH-1                 31                MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nfrom the driver of the car in question and not from the\n\nrelative of the deceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">     35. In the Judgment at Sl.No.2, earlier it was pleaded\n\nin the complaint that accident might be due to crashing of\n\nthe motorcycle to the metal guard which was on the side of\n\nthe road or due to accident by unknown vehicle and only\n\nafter one and half months from the date of the accident,\n\nthe car has come into picture in the seizure mahazar. In\n\nthis context, His Lordship has observed that when the\n\ninvolvement of the insured vehicle in the accident is\n\ndisputed, it is for the claimants to place acceptable\n\nevidence to prove its involvement and to prove that the\n\naccident arose out of the use of the insured vehicle, but\n\nfiling of complaint to the police, or filing of chargesheet by\n\nthe police, by itself is no of proof of involvement of the\n\nvehicle in question.    In the present case, as discussed\n\nabove, the claimants have placed acceptable evidence to\n\nprove the involvement of the insured car in accident and as\n\nsuch, the said Judgment is not applicable to the present\n\ncase on hand.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\"> SCCH-1                     32               MVC No.104/2020</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">     36.     In the Judgment at Sl.No.3 also, His Lordship\n\nhas observed that the claimant has not placed any\n\nacceptable evidence to establish the involvement of the\n\nvehicle in question as well as the negligence on the part of\n\nthe rider of the vehicle in question and even some material\n\nfacts have been suppressed by the claimant regarding his\n\ntreatment. But, in the present case, the petitioners have\n\nplaced acceptable evidence which proves their case.\n\nTherefore, this Judgment is also not applicable to the\n\npresent case on hand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">     37. In the Judgment at Sl.No.4, His Lordship has\n\nobserved that the involvement of the vehicle was not\n\nestablished by the claimants, but implication of the vehicle\n\nin accident has been established and as such, alleged\n\ninvolvement of the truck in question is nothing but the\n\nmanipulation committed by the police at the instance of\n\nthe claimants to benefit them.         In the present case, as\n\ndiscussed above, this court has come to the conclusion\n\nthat the petitioners have proved the involvement of the\n\ninsured     vehicle   in    accident   by   placing   satisfactory\n\nevidence.     Such being the case, the question of false\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\"> SCCH-1               33                 MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nimplication of the insured car in question do not arise. As\n\nsuch, this Judgment is not applicable to the present case\n\non hand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">     38. In the Judgment at Sl.No.5, Her Ladyship has\n\nobserved that the evidence on record goes to show that the\n\nentire negligence was on the part of the deceased, since he\n\nwas riding his motorcycle under the influence of alcohol\n\nand since he himself has hit against the stationed\n\noffending vehicle, resulting in accident. Even the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the said Judgment differs from the facts\n\nand circumstances of the present case on hand.       Hence,\n\nthe said Judgment is not applicable to the present case on\n\nhand.    Therefore, by considering the evidence placed on\n\nrecord and by considering the circumstances that are\n\nbrought out in the evidence placed before the court, I am of\n\nthe opinion that the petitioners have proved that the\n\ndeceased met with an accident and succumbed to the\n\naccidental injuries in an accident caused by the driver of\n\nthe car bearing registration No.KA-02-AG-1786, on account\n\nof his rash and negligent driving of the car.

These   documents       clearly   establish   that   the\n\npetitioners are the wife and children of the deceased.\n\nHence, it can be said that the petitioners are the legal heirs\n\nof deceased Sriramulu and they are entitled to claim\n\ncompensation on account of death of the deceased.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">     40.

Except the oral assertion of PW.1, there is no\n\nproof of avocation and income of the deceased. As such,\n\nthe notional income of the deceased has to be taken into\n\nconsideration as per <a href=\"/doc/142278/\" id=\"a_12\">Minimum Wages Act</a>.              As such, the\n\naverage income of the deceased is taken at Rs.11,500/- per\n\nmonth. PW.1 has deposed that his father was aged about\n\n50 years at the time of his death. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"837924\" id=\"span_36\">In order to prove the age\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\"> SCCH-1                 35              MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nof the deceased, PW.1 has produced the Aadhaar Card of\n\nthe deceased as per Ex.P.9.

Such\n\nbeing the case, even the evidence of RW.2 is of no help to\n\nthe second respondent to prove that the insured has\n\nallowed the vehicle to ply at the place of accident without\n\nvalid permit. The evidence of RWs 1 and 2 makes it clear\n\nthat if a commercial vehicle is required to travel from one\n\nState to another State, in the check-post temporary permit\n\nwill be issued. But, the evidence of RWs 1 and 2 do not\n\ndisclose    whether   the   first   respondent   had   obtained\n\ntemporary permit to travel outside Karnataka at the time of\n\naccident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_93\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\">     52. RW.1 has deposed that, in this case private\n\ninvestigator was not appointed, but only documents were\n\ncollected. If that is so, then the second respondent would\n\nhave collected the information regarding obtaining of\n\ntemporary permit to ascertain whether the insured vehicle\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\"> SCCH-1                     45                 MVC No.104/2020</span>\n\n\n\n\nwas plied without valid permit at the place of accident.\n\nBut, the second respondent has not made any efforts to\n\nenquire whether the insured had taken any temporary\n\npermit in the check-post to ply his vehicle outside\n\nKarnataka. Hence, by considering all these aspects, I am\n\nof the opinion that only on the evidence of RWs 1 and 2, it\n\nis not possible to believe that the insured has allowed his\n\ndriver to ply the vehicle outside Karnataka without valid\n\npermit. Even it is noticed that in the chargesheet, no\n\noffence has been charged against the accused or the owner\n\nof the insured vehicle as to plying the vehicle at the place\n\nof accident without valid permit. Even no suggestion was\n\nmade to RW.4 regarding non-mentioning of the offence for\n\nplying the vehicle at the place of accident without valid\n\npermit    in   the    chargesheet,    since   he   has   filed   the\n\nchargesheet. By considering all these aspects, I am of the\n\nopinion    that      the   second    respondent    except   taking\n\ncontention in the written statement, has not chosen to\n\nprove that the insured has allowed his driver to ply the\n\ninsured vehicle at the place of accident without valid\n\npermit.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\"> SCCH-1                  46                   MVC No.104/2020</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_95\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_96\">     53. The insurance policy at Ex.R.2 discloses that the\n\ninsurance policy was issued to the first respondent in\n\nrespect of the car in question and it was valid as on the\n\ndate of accident.
