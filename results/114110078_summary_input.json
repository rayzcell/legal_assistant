Despite the cross­examination,\nthe oral testimony of PW­2 supports the case of the petitioners regarding the\noccurrence of the accident and also the manner thereof.

During the course of enquiry, it has come on record that the\noffending vehicle was parked in the second lane of the road at the relevant\ntime. The cross­examination of PW­2 has also thrown up certain interesting\nfacts which are being mentioned hereinafter. Admittedly, the accident took\nplace in the month of August and there was no rain or fog in the area at the\nrelevant time. Admittedly, the visibility was clear at the relevant time. In\nthese circumstances, even if the statement of PW­2, to the effect that the\naccidental car was being driven by R­4 at the speed of 60 KM per hour at the\nrelevant time, is believed to be a gospels truth, still the petitioners failed to\nconvince this Tribunal as to why the accidental car dashed into the rear of the\noffending vehicle in the facts and circumstances noted above in this\nparagraph. In the absence of any averment regarding any mechanical defect\nin the accidental car or intervention by an extraneous cause, this Tribunal is\nconstrained to hold that the driver of the accidental car was guilty of driving\nhis vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and was responsible for the\noccurrence of accident.

No explanation has been put forth by R­1 as to why\nthe offending vehicle was parked in the middle of the road at the relevant\ntime. In the absence of any explanation, this Tribunal is constrained to hold\nthat the act and conduct of R­1 was also not upto the mark, was rather in\nviolation of the relevant traffic rules and regulations and contributed to the\noccurrence of the accident.

None of the respondents dispute the fact that the deceased\nsustained fatal injuries and the injured sustained grievous injuries in the\naccident in question. The certified copies of records of the Criminal Court as\nare available in the judicial file reflects the postmortem report of the\ndeceased and the MLR (Medico­Legal Report) of the injured which are\nconsistent with the version put forth by the petitioners in both the case.

Similarly, the medical records proved during the\npresent proceedings by the injured (Ex. PW2/1) corroborates the claim of\nthe injured in the connected case. In the entire facts and circumstances\nnoted above, this Tribunal holds that the deceased suffered fatal injuries and\nthe injured suffered grievous injuries in a road accident which took place on\naccount of the neglect and default of R­1 and R­4 in driving the offending\nvehicle and the accidental car respectively.

Coming to the dependency of deceased at the time of accident, it\n is observed that petitioners claim that the deceased was survived by his\n father (aged 70 years), mother (aged 64 years) and one widow (aged 23\n years). Keeping in view the advanced age of the father of the petitioner at\n the time of death of deceased, it would not be inappropriate to presume that\n the father of the deceased was also dependent upon the deceased.\n Accordingly, all the petitioners shall be treated as dependents of the\n deceased for the purpose of present petition.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"74988840\" id=\"span_41\">21.         Irrespective of this, 1/3rd of earnings of deceased shall be\n deducted towards his personal and living expenses in view of the law\n already discussed above. Further, since this Tribunal has assumed that the\n age of deceased was 31 years at the time of accident, in view of the law laid\n down in the case of <a href=\"/doc/74988840/\" id=\"a_10\">Pranay Sethi &amp; Ors.</a> (Supra), the petitioner is also\n held entitled to an addition of 40% of the above amount of his earnings\n towards future prospects.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\"> 22.

Although, the injured has summoned and\nproved his ITRs for the Assessment Years 2010­11, 2011­12 and 2012­13 as\nEx. PW6/1(colly). However, he has not summoned the subsequent ITR\nwhich could have reflected the decreased/ fall, if any, in the income of the\ninjured subsequent to the accident.     The injured has chosen to hold back a\nrelevant piece of evidence which was necessary for deciding as to whether or\nnot he suffered any loss of income in the aftermath of the accident and\ntherefore, this Tribunal is not inclined to uphold the bald oral testimony of\ninjured in this regard. Be that as it may, the discharge summary of the injured\nEx. PW2/1(colly) reveals that the injured suffered multiple fractures due to\nthe accident in different parts of the body and had to undergo surgical\nprocedures for necessary corrections including implantation of plates. The\nnature of injuries sustained by the injured would have definitely impeded the\nnormal functioning of the injured for at least 03 months.
