Act, 1998, it is\nmandatory duty of the insured/Respondent No.1, to furnish the\nparticulars of policy, RC, DL and FC, but, the insured/Respondent\nNo.1 has not complied with statutory demand. Hence, he is not\nliable to pay compensation.\n SCCH-7                         10                 MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\n     e)    The driver was driving the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car\nbearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9823, without possessing a\nvalid and effective driving licence on the date of the alleged\naccident.

But, the Thalaghattapura Police\nStation Authorities have failed to forward the documents and not\ncomplied with the statutory demand.\n\n\n     g)    The Petitioners claimed interest at the rate of 12%,\nwhich is highly excessive and the same is contrary to <a href=\"/doc/196386/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 3</a> of\nthe Interest Act, 1978 and the observation of the various\nJudgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court.\n\n\n     h)    The Petitioners are not entitled to claim any interest on\nnon-pecuniary damages as per the observations of Judgment of\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court.\n\n\n     i)    The deceased&#x27;s driver drove the Car on the road in a\nnegligent manner without taking proper precautions and without\nobserving the movement of the vehicles. The accident occurred\nduring the evening at around 4-10 p.m. The deceased&#x27;s driver\nwithout having proper conscious, along with the four other\ninmates had consumed alcohol, i.e., &#x27;Drink and Drive&#x27; as per the\n SCCH-7                           11                MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nPostmortem and FSL Report, the driver himself hit the said BMTC\nBus while driving on the road. The deceased driver in having\ntaken the risk while having consumed alcohol and driving on the\nroad in a haphazard manner being the evening hours without\ntaking proper precautions, without noticing the oncoming vehicles\nand as such, the Petitioners are not entitled to any compensation\nfrom him.\n\n\n      j)      He craves leave of this Hon&#x27;ble Court to take all\ndefences available to it, under <a href=\"/doc/184045376/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 170</a> of M.V.

Hence, prayed to dismiss the petition with costs, else, his\nCompany will be put to irreparable loss and injury.\n\n\n      9.      The Respondent No.4 inter-alia denying the entire case\nof the Petitioners in M.V.C.No.1097/2014, has further contended\nas follows;\n SCCH-7                            12                 MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\n      a)    At the out-set, the very petition is misconceived and\nnot maintainable either in law or on facts.\n\n\n      b)    The BMTC Bus bearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-\n1241 on 14.09.2013 was in its schedule trip from Banashankari\nto Kempaiahnapalya in Route No.213D/1. When the Bus was\nproceeding, in a road in front of Somanahally KEB, slowly,\ncautiously by following all the traffic rules in extreme left side of\nthe road (mud road adjacent to the Tar road), the driver of the\nSwift Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825 came in a\nopposite   direction   in   a   rash   and   negligent   manner    with\nintoxication of alcohol along with other inmates of the Car, those\nwere also under the intoxication of alcohol and all of a sudden\ndeviated to extreme right (wrong direction) and dashed as against\nthe BMTC Bus with great force at left side of the Bus and caused\nthe accident. In this process, the driver of the Car exposed to that\nangle and caused the accident. If the driver of the Car had taken\nlittle care while driving the Car, the alleged accident could have\nbeen avoided. Under those circumstances, he is not at all\nresponsible for the alleged accident nor his driver and at any rate,\nhe is not liable to pay any compensation, much less, the huge\namount claimed in the petition vicariously or otherwise as alleged\nin the petition.\n\n\n      c)    The compensation claimed Rupees 40,00,000/- for the\ndeath of deceased is highly excessive, exorbitant, imaginary,\nunaffordable and astromical and have no relation to facts and\ncircumstances of the case. He is not liable to pay the same as\n SCCH-7                              13                        MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nclaimed under the facts and circumstances of the case, that too,\nwhen actually the driver of the Car exposed for the accident by his\nown negligent and careless attitude.\n\n\n     d)     The averments made in Column 22 by way of\nadditional and other information has been used by the Petitioners\nfor the purpose of concocting false and unbelievable story for the\npurpose of somehow extracting a huge compensation from him for\nthe alleged accident, for which, neither BMTC Bus not his driver\nin no way responsible, connected or concerned and they are not at\nall responsible for the accident.\n\n\n     e)     The averments made with an oblique motive by the\nPetitioners in order to extract huge sum by way of compensation,\nwhen actually he or his driver was not at all responsible for the\naccident.\n\n\n     f)     He    reserves   his    right       to   file   additional   Written\nStatement, if the occasion demands at later date or stage. Hence,\nprayed to dismiss the petition with exemplary cost.\n\n\n     10.    The     Petitioners          No.1        and     2    have      filed\nM.V.C.No.1095/2014 as against the Respondents No.1 to 4 under\n<a href=\"/doc/136948773/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 166</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1989, praying to award\ncompensation of Rupees 40,00,000/- with costs, in respect of\ndeath of Sri.

In order to prove their respective cases, the Petitioners\nin M.V.C.No.1097/2014 have examined the Petitioner No.1 as\nP.W.1 by filing an affidavit as his examination-in-chief and have\nplaced reliance upon Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.10 and Ex.P.16 to Ex.P.21\nand the Petitioners in M.V.C.No.1095/2014 have examined the\nPetitioner No.1 as P.W.2 by filing an affidavit as his examination-\nin-chief and have placed reliance upon Ex.P.11 to Ex.P.15,\nEx.P.22 to Ex.P.25 and Ex.P.35 to Ex.P.36 and the Petitioners in\nM.V.C.No.1096/2014 have examined the Petitioner No.1 as P.W.3\nfiling an affidavit as his examination-in-chief and have placed\nreliance upon Ex.P.26 to Ex.P.33, Ex.P.37 and Ex.P.38.

Heard the arguments.\n\n\n     30.      In support of the submission, the Learned Counsel\nappearing for the Petitioners Sri. Rahamathulla Kothwal has\nplaced reliance upon the decision reported in,\n\n\n     Civil Appeal No.8612 of 2013 Supreme Court of India (M.\nMansoor and Another V/s. United India Insurance Company\nLtd., and Another), wherein, it is observed that,\n\n\n                    17. Appellants produced the salary\n               certificate of deceased Amjath Khan Arabu,\n               which has been marked as Ex.P.8. It shows\n               that, the deceased was earning Rupees\n               18,100/- per month. The Tribunal has\n               rightly taken into consideration the\n               aforesaid income for computing the\n               compensation. The annual income comes to\n               Rupees 2,17,200/-. If 50% of the said\n               income is deducted towards personal and\n               living expenses of the deceased the\n               contribution to the family will be Rupees\n               1,08,600/-. At the time of accident, the\n               deceased Amjath Khan Arabu was a\n               bachelor about 24 years old hence on the\n               basis of the decision in Sarla Verma Case\n               (supra) applying the multiplier of 18, the\n               amount will come to Rupees 19,54,800/-.\n SCCH-7                             32                    MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\n             Besides this amount the claimants are\n             entitled to get Rupees 50,000/- each\n             towards the loss of affection of the son, i.e.,\n             Rupees 1,00,000/- and Rupees 10,000/- on\n             account of funeral and ritual expenses.\n             Therefore, the total amount comes to\n             Rupees 20,64,800/- and the claimants are\n             entitled to get the said amount of\n             compensation instead of the amount\n             awarded by the Tribunal and the High\n             Court. They would also be entitled to get\n             interst at the rate of 6% per annum from\n             the date of the filing of the claim petition till\n             realization.\n\n     31.

ISSUE NO.1 IN M.V.C.NO.1097/2014 :- The P.W.1,\nwho is the Petitioner No.1 in M.V.C.No.1097/2014, has stated in\nhis examination-in-chief that, the Petitioner No.2 is his wife and\nthe deceased Syed Ayub Pasha was their son, who died in the road\ntraffic accident, which was taken place on 14.09.2013, when he\nwas traveling in the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration\nNo.KA-03-ML-9825 with 4 other persons including the driver Yasir\nKhan and due to the said accident, his son Syed Ayub Pasha died\non the spot due to the accidental injuries. He has further stated\nthat, they were depending upon their son for their livelihood. The\nPetitioners have produced Ex.P.1 FIR, Ex.P.2 Complaint, Ex.P.4\nInquest, Ex.P.5 Postmortem Report, Ex.P.6 Death Certificate\nrelating to Syed Ayub Pasha, Ex.P.16 B.Com Certificate relating to\nSyed Ayub Pasha, Ex.P.17 Aashaar Card relating to Syed Iliyaz\nPasha, Ex.P.18 Aadahar Card relating to Raziya Sultana, Ex.P.19\nElection Identity Card relating to Syed Ayub Pasha, Ex.P.20\nElection Identity Card relating to Syed Iliyaz Pasha and Ex.P.21\nElection Identity Card relating to Raziya Sultana. On perusal of\nthe said oral evidence of P.W.1 coupled with the contents of the\nsaid material documents, it clearly goes to show that, the\nPetitioner No.1 is a father and the Petitioner No.2 is a mother of\nthe deceased Syed Ayub Pasha, who died due to the accidental\ninjuries on the accidental spot itself on 14.09.2013 at 1-30 p.m.,\nwhen he was traveling in the offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car\nbearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825, which hit to the BMTC\n SCCH-7                         35                 MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nBus bearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-1241. Hence, it can be\nsafely held that, the Petitioner No.1 being a father and the\nPetitioner No.2 being a mother are the legal representatives of the\nsaid deceased. But, based on the same, it cannot be said that,\nboth the Petitioners are the dependents upon the said deceased,\nas, it is well settled principle of law that, the father cannot be\nconsidered as a dependent upon the son and though the P.W.1 in\nhis cross-examination has stated that, he is not doing any work,\nto consider the same, no acceptable material documentary\nevidence is produced by the Petitioners. Hence, the Petitioners\nNo.2 being a mother of the deceased can only be considered as a\ndependent upon the said deceased. Accordingly, I answered\nIssue No.1 in M.V.C.No.1097/2014 partly in the Affirmative.\n\n\n     33.    ISSUE NO.1 IN M.V.C.NO.1095/2014 :- The P.W.2,\nwho is the Petitioner No.1 in M.V.C.No.1095/2014, has stated in\nhis examination-in-chief that, the Petitioner No.2 is his wife and\nthe deceased Mohammed Junaid was their son, who died in the\nroad traffic accident, which was taken place on 14.09.2013, when\nhe was traveling in the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing\nRegistration No.KA-03-ML-9825 with 4 other persons including\nthe driver Yasir Khan and due to the said accident, his son\nMohammed Junaid died on the spot due to the accidental injuries.\nHe has further stated that, they were depending upon their son for\ntheir livelihood. The Petitioners have produced Ex.P.11 Burial\nReport dated 17.09.2013, Ex.P.12 Death Certificate relating to\nMohammed Junaid, Ex.P.15 Aadhaar Card relating to Mohammed\nJunaid, Ex.P.22 SSLC Marks Card relating to Mohammed Junaid,\n SCCH-7                          36                MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nEx.P.23 Aadhaar Card relating to Mohammed Junaid, Ex.P.24\nAadahar Card relating to Moahmmed Sayeed, Ex.P.25 Aadhaar\nCard relating to Asma Jabeen, Ex.P.35 Inquest and Ex.P.36\nPostmortem Report. On perusal of the said oral evidence of P.W.2\ncoupled with the contents of the said material documents, it\nclearly goes to show that, the Petitioner No.1 is a father and the\nPetitioner No.2 is a mother of the deceased Mohammed Junaid,\nwho died due to the accidental injuries on the accidental spot\nitself on 14.09.2013 at 1-30 p.m., when he was traveling in the\noffending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-\nML-9825, which hit to the BMTC Bus bearing Registration No.KA-\n01-FA-1241. Hence, it can be safely held that, the Petitioner No.1\nbeing a father and the Petitioner No.2 being a mother are the legal\nrepresentatives of the said deceased. But, based on the same, it\ncannot be said that, both the Petitioners are the dependents upon\nthe said deceased, as, it is well settled principle of law that, the\nfather cannot be considered as a dependent upon the son.\nFurther, the P.W.2 in his cross-examination has clearly stated\nthat, he is working in a Hotel as a Assistant, which clearly\ndisclosed that, the Petitioner No.1, who is a father of the deceased\nis having his own independent income. Hence, the Petitioners No.2\nbeing a mother of the deceased can only be considered as a\ndependent upon the said deceased. Accordingly, I answered\nIssue No.1 in M.V.C.No.1095/2014 partly in the Affirmative\n\n\n     34.    ISSUE NO.1 IN M.V.C.NO.1096/2014 :- The P.W.3,\nwho is the Petitioner No.1 in M.V.C.No.1096/2014, has stated in\nhis examination-in-chief that, the Petitioner No.2 is his wife and\n SCCH-7                             37                      MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nthe deceased Mayur Sharma was their son, who died in the road\ntraffic accident, which was taken place on 14.09.2013, when he\nwas traveling in the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration\nNo.KA-03-ML-9825 with 4 other persons including the driver Yasir\nKhan and due to the said accident, his son Mayur Sharma died on\nthe spot due to the accidental injuries. He has further stated that,\nthey were depending upon their son for their livelihood. The\nPetitioners     have   produced     Ex.P.26       Burial     Report    dated\n15.09.2013, Ex.P.27 Death Certificate relating to Mayur Sharma,\nEx.P.28 Certificate dated 14.01.2015, Ex.P.29 SSLC Marks Card\nrelating to Mayur Sharma.

On perusal of the said oral evidence of P.W.3 coupled with\nthe contents of the said material documents, it clearly goes to\nshow that, the Petitioner No.1 is a father and the Petitioner No.2 is\na mother of the deceased Mayur Sharma, who died due to the\naccidental injuries on the accidental spot itself on 14.09.2013 at\n1-30 p.m., when he was traveling in the offending Maruthi Swift\nDzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825, which hit to\nthe BMTC Bus bearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-1241. Hence, it\ncan be safely held that, the Petitioner No.1 being a father and the\nPetitioner No.2 being a mother are the legal representatives of the\nsaid deceased. But, based on the same, it cannot be said that,\nboth the Petitioners are the dependents upon the said deceased,\nas, it is well settled principle of law that, the father cannot be\n SCCH-7                           38                  MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nconsidered as a dependent upon the son. Further, the P.W.3 in his\ncross-examination has clearly stated that, he is working as a\nManager in Jain Trust, which clearly disclosed that, the Petitioner\nNo.1, who is a father of the deceased, is having his own\nindependent income. Hence, the Petitioners No.2 being a mother\nof the deceased can only be considered as a dependent upon the\nsaid     deceased.   Accordingly,     I   answered   Issue   No.1       in\nM.V.C.No.1096/2014 partly in the Affirmative\n\n\n       35.   ISSUE NO.2 IN ALL THE CASES :- The P.W.1, who is\nthe Petitioner No.1 in M.V.C.No.1097/2014 has stated in his\nexamination-in-chief that, on 14.09.2013 his deceased son Syed\nAyub Pasha was traveling in the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing\nRegistration No.KA-03-ML-9825 with 4 other including the driver\nYasir Khan and while they were moving in front of Sommanahalli\nKEB Quarters on Bangalore - Kanakapura Road at about 1-10\np.m., the driver of the vehicle drove the vehicle in a rash and\nnegligent manner and due to the front right side tyre burst of the\nCar, the driver of the vehicle lost control of the Car and the Car hit\nto the BMTC Bus bearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-1241 and due\nto the accident, all the 5 inmates of the Car including his deceased\nson died on the spot due to the accidental injuries. He has further\nstated that, on 14.09.2013, the said accident occurred due to the\nrash and negligent act of the driver of the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car\nbearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825 and the Thalaghattapura\nPolice Station have registered a Case No.589/2013 as against the\ndriver of the said offending vehicle.\n SCCH-7                             39                    MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\n      36.   The   P.W.2,     who        is    the   Petitioner   No.1       in\nM.V.C.No.1095/2014 has stated the same evidence of P.W.1, in\nhis   examination-in-chief   and        has   further   stated   that,      on\n14.09.2013, his son deceased Mohammed Junaid was traveling in\nthe Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-\n9825, who died on the spot due to the accidental injuries.\n\n\n      37.   The   P.W.3,     who        is    the   Petitioner   No.1       in\nM.V.C.No.1096/2014 has also stated the same evidence of P.W.1\nand P.W.2, in his examination-in-chief and has further stated\nthat, on 14.09.2013 his son deceased Mayur Sharma was\ntraveling in the Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration\nNo.KA-03-ML-9825, who died on the spot due to the accidental\ninjuries.\n\n\n      38.   No doubt, the P.W.1 to P.W.3 are not the eye witnesses\nof the accident in question. In this regard, they have stated in\ntheir cross-examination that, they have not seen the accident.\nFurther, the P.W.1 to P.W.3 have not lodged the complaint about\nthe alleged accident before the jurisdictional Police in respect of\nthe accident caused to their respective sons. In this regard, the\nP.W.1 to P.W.3 have also stated in their cross-examination that,\nthey have not lodged a complaint about the alleged accident.\nFurther, the P.W.1 to P.W.3 have clearly stated in their cross-\nexamination that, they have not challenged the Charge Sheet filed\nby the concerned Police by alleging that, at the time of accident,\nall the inmates of the Car including their son are not under the\ninfluence of intoxication. They have clearly stated that, they have\n SCCH-7                         40                 MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nnot challenged the Charge Sheet filed by the Investigating Officer\nby preferring an appeal before the Hon&#x27;ble Appellate Court. It is\npertinent to note here that, after investigation, the Investigating\nOfficer has filed the Charge Sheet as against the driver of the\noffending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-\nML-9825, namely, Yasir Khan, wherein, all 3 deceased were\ntraveling in the said Maruthi Swift Dzire Car. It is further\npertinent to note here that, in the Charge Sheet, it is alleged by\nthe Investigating Officer that, at the time of accident, the said\ndriver Yasir Khan was under the influence of intoxication. Further,\nthe P.W.1 to P.W.3 have shown their ignorance about the contents\nof the Charge Sheet as well as the complaint that, they do not\nknow the contents of the complaint and the Police have filed the\nCharge Sheet as against the driver of the Car, namely, Yaseer\nKhan.

Naseer Hussain is a son of the\nRespondent No.1. It is pertinent to note here that, though the\nnotice was duly served on the Respondent No.1, he was remained\nabsent and hence, he is placed as exparte. If really, there was no\nnegligence on the part of the driver of the said offending Car,\nnamely, Yasir Khan S/o. Naseer Hussain, in the commission of\nthe said road traffic accident and the said accident was taken\nplace due to burst of the front wheel of the said Car and due to\nwhich, the said deceased driver had not controlled over the said\nCar and the said deceased driver was not under the influence of\nalcohol at the time of accident, the Respondent No.1 being a father\nof the said deceased driver and owner of the said offending Car\ncould have been definitely challenged the very registration of the\ncriminal case as against his deceased son, by preferring an appeal\nor revision before the Hon&#x27;ble Appellate Court. Further, the\nRespondent No.1 could have definitely contested all the petitions\nby filing the Written Statement. The non-appearance of the\n SCCH-7                          45                MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nRespondent No.1 in all the petitions clearly implies that, he has\nindirectly admitted the entire case made out by the Petitioners as\nagainst his deceased son, who was a driver of the offending\nMaruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825.\nWhen the entire negligence is on the part of the deceased driver of\nthe said offending Swift Dzire Car, non-challenging of the Charge\nSheet by all the Petitioners by preferring an appeal or revision\nbefore the Hon&#x27;ble Appellate Court questioning the allegations\nmade by the Investigating Officer in the Charge Sheet that, at the\ntime of accident, all the inmates of the Car including their were\nsons under intoxication, cannot be arise for consideration at all.\nFurther, the P.W.1 to P.W.3 have clearly stated in their cross-\nexamination that, in the said Car, Ayub Pasha, Naseer, Mayur,\nZunudh, Yarab and Yaseer were traveling to Kanakapura for\nparty, which was arranged for the persons, who are going to\nHudge on 16.09.2013 and the Thousif Ahamed telephoned them\nabout the accident and on that day, there were 5 persons in the\nCar and the right tye of the said Car was burst. Furthermore, the\nRespondent No.2 has not produced Investigation Report, which is\nprepared by their Investigating Officer.

He has further stated that, the width of the accidental\nroad was 35-40 ft. On perusal of the said evidence of R.W.3, it is\nfurther made crystal clear that, if the deceased driver of the\n SCCH-7                          46                    MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\noffending Car was not under the influence of alcohol and he was\nnot driving with it with very high speed, rash and negligent\nmanner at the time of accident, he could have avoided the said\nroad traffic accident and could have saved the valuable life of all\nthe deceased, including him. From this, it is made crystal clear\nthat, the entire negligence is on the part of the driver of the\noffending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-\nML-9825 and there was no negligence on the part of the R.W.3 in\nthe commission of the said road traffic accident, when he was a\ndriver of the BMTC Bus bearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-1241\nand there was no contributory negligence on the part of the\ndeceased, who are travelling in the said offending Car, when the\ndeceased driver driving it at the time of accident.\n\n\n     40.

The contents of Ex.P.3 Spot Panchanama and Ex.P.34\nMVI Report clearly disclosed that, the entire negligence is on the\npart of the driver of the offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing\nRegistration No.KA-03-ML-9825, who dashed to the BMTC Bus\nbearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-1241 and at the time of\naccident, the driver of the said offending Car was driving it with\nvery high speed rash and negligent manner and due to which, the\n SCCH-7                             48                      MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\ntyre of the said Car was burst and there was no negligence on the\npart of the driver of the Bus bearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-\n1241 in the commission of the said road traffic accident.

But, while discussing\nabove, this Tribunal has already observed and come to the\nconclusion that, there was no contributory negligence on the part\nof the said deceased in the commission of the said road traffic\naccident and the entire negligence is on the part of the driver of\nthe offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-\n03-ML-9825, namely, Yasir Khan, who was driving it with very\nhigh speed, rash and negligent manner at the time of accident and\nat that time, the wheel of the offending Car was burst and took\nright side and dashed to the said BMTB Bus.

The contents of Ex.R.1 Charge Sheet further clearly\ndisclosed that, the driver of the offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car\nbearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825, namely, Yasir Khan was\ndriving it with very high speed, rash and negligent manner from\n SCCH-7                          50                  MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nKanakapura towards Bangalore on 14.09.2013 at 4-10 p.m., in\nfront of KEB Official Quarters, Bangalore to Kanakapura Main\nRoad, N.H.209 near Somanahalli Village, Utharahalli, Bangalore\nSouth Taluk and due to which, the front wheel of the said Car was\nburst and the said deceased driver could not control the said Car\nand due to which, it dashed to the front portion of the BMTC Bus\nbearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-1241, which was coming on\nopposite direction and due to which, the said Car was entered into\nlower portion of the said Bus and the inmates of the said Car Syed\nAyub Pasha, Mohammed Junid, Mayur Sharma and Yarab Abbas\nhad sustained grievous injuries on their head, hands and all over\nthe body and died all the said 5 persons on the accidental spot\nitself and at the time of accident, the driver of the said Car as well\nas inmates were under the influence of the alcohol and as such,\nafter thorough investigation, the Investigating Officer has filed a\ncharge sheet as against the driver of the offending Car for the\noffences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1270101/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 279</a> and <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_31\">304(A)</a> of IPC R/w\n<a href=\"/doc/139481594/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 185</a> of IMV Act. From this, it is made crystal clear that,\nthe entire negligence is on the part of the driver of the offending\nCar, who was also under the influence of alcohol, who died in the\nsaid accident itself.\n\n\n      47.   From the above said material evidence, both oral and\ndocumentary, it is clearly proved that, the entire negligence is on\nthe part of the deceased driver, namely, Yasir Khan S/o.

Accordingly,       I\nanswered        Issues      No.2        in      M.V.C.No.1097/2014,\nM.V.C.No.1095/2014         and      M.V.C.No.1096/2014            in    the\nAffirmative.\n\n\n     48.

The date\nof accident is on 14.09.2013. On perusal of the said dates, it\nappears that, at the time of accident, the said deceased was 24\nyears old.

Further, the P.W.1 in his cross-examination has\nstated that, he has no hurdle to examine the employer of his\ndeceased son to consider his income at the time of accident.\nFurther, the employer of the deceased also not been examined by\nthe Petitioners.

The P.W.1 has stated that, at the time of accident, his\nson deceased Syed Ayub Pasha was hale, healthy and hard\nworking and was having bright future and further his son was\nsupporting his family financially and due to the death of his son in\nthe said accident, they are finding extremely difficult to eake out\ntheir livelihood and they are put heavy financial stress and\nfurther, they are put to untold misery, financial loss, mental agony\nand hardship due to the tragic death of their son in the said\naccident.\n\n\n     52.    While answering Issue No.1, this Tribunal has already\nobserved and come to the conclusion that, the Petitioners are the\nlegal representatives and the Petitioner No.2 is a dependent upon\nthe said deceased.

Hence,\nthe Petitioners No.1 and 2 being the legal representatives and the\nPetitioner No.2 being a dependent upon the said deceased are\nentitled for compensation under the following heads.\n\n\n     53.    As per the decision reported in 2013 ACJ 1403\n(Rajesh and Others V/s Rajbir Singh and Others) and as the\ndeceased was aged 24 years at the time of accident, towards\nfuture prospects 50% of the income has to be added. So, 50% of\nRupees 10,000/- comes to Rupees 5,000/-. Therefore, the income\nof the deceased comes to Rupees 15,000/- p.m. (Rs.10,000/- +\n5,000/-).\n\n\n     54.    The Petitioner No.2 is considered as a dependent of the\ndeceased. Therefore, deceased left behind one dependent. As per\nthe principles laid down in ILR 2012 KAR 2859 (New India\nAssurance Co. Ltd., represented by Senior Divisional Manager\nV/s. Sri. David. T. and Another), whenever there is a sole\ndependent, deduction of 50% towards personal expenses is\nproper. Therefore, considering the number of the dependent, i.e.,\n1, 50% of the income has to be deducted towards personal\nexpenses    of   the   deceased,    i.e.,   Rupees   7,500/-   (50%      of\nRs.15,000/-). Therefore, loss of dependency comes to Rupees\n7,500/- (Rs.15,000/- (-) Rs.7,500/-). The multiplier corresponding\nto the age of the deceased, i.e., 24 years, is 18 as per Sarala\nVarma&#x27;s Case. Therefore, loss of dependency comes to Rupees\n16,20,000/- (Rs.7,500/- x 12 x 18). Therefore, the Petitioners are\n SCCH-7                           55                   MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nentitled for Rupees 16,20,000/- towards loss of dependency due to\ndeath of Syed Ayub Pasha S/o Syed illyaz Pasha.\n\n\n      55.

As this Tribunal has already observed that, the\nPetitioner No.1 is a father and the Petitioner No.2 is a mother of\nthe deceased. Hence, the Petitioners are entitled for a sum of\nRupees 25,000/- towards loss of love and affection and Rupees\n25,000/- towards funeral expenses.\n\n\n      57.   It is just, proper and necessary to award a sum of\nRupees 5,000/- towards transportation expenses of the dead body\nof deceased and Rupees 20,000/- towards loss of estate. Hence,\nthe   Petitioners   are   entitled    for   Rupees   5,000/-    towards\ntransportation expenses of the dead body of the deceased and\nRupees 20,000/- towards loss of estate.\n\n\n      58.

ISSUE NO.3 IN M.V.C.NO.1095/2014 :- The P.W.2\nhas stated that, at the time of death, his son was only aged 21\nyears. The Petitioners have produced Ex.P.22 SSLC Marks Card\nrelating to the deceased Mohammed Junaid, which disclosed that,\nhis date of birth is on 20.05.1992. The date of accident is on\n14.09.2013. On perusal of the said dates, it appears that, at the\ntime of accident, the said deceased was 22 years old. Hence, the\nage of the deceased is considered as 22 years at the time of\naccident.\n\n\n        61.    The P.W.2 has stated that, his deceased son was\nstudying in 2nd PUC and along with his studies, he was also doing\nfull time job in the night shift in Aditya Birla Minacs Worldwide\nLimited, Bangalore, OPS APAC-CRM-Delivery Department and his\n SCCH-7                         57                 MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nsalary was Rupees 15,928/- p.m. The P.W.2 in his cross-\nexamination has stated that, his deceased son was working as a\nClerk in Aditya Birla Minacs Worldwide Ltd., Bangalore. The\nPetitioners have produced Ex.P.13 Pay Slip for the Month of July\n2011 and Ex.P.14 Appointment dated 21.04.2011 along with\nAnnexure. The said evidence of P.W.2 as well as the contents of\nEx.P.13 and Ex.P.14 disclosed that, at the time of accident, the\nsaid deceased was working at Aditya Birla Minacs Worldwide\nLimited and his Gross Salary was of Rupees 15,928/- p.m., and\nNet Salary was of Rupees 14,539/-. But, based on the same, it\ncannot be said and come to the conclusion that, at the time of\naccident, the said deceased was earning Rupees 15,928/- p.m., as\nGross Salary and Rupees 14,539/- p.m., as Net Salary, as,\nEx.P.13 Pay Slip is relating to the Month of July 2011, which is\nmuch prior to the date of accident. Further, the Petitioners have\nnot produced the pay slip of the said deceased covering the date of\naccident and the Bank Statement to show the actual income of the\ndeceased at the time of accident. Even, the Petitioners have not\nexamined the employer of the said deceased to consider his nature\nof work and income at the time of accident. In this regard, the\nP.W.2 in his cross-examination has clearly stated that, he has not\nproduced the pay slips relating to his deceased son for the year\n2013 and also the Bank statement to show his actual income at\nthe time of accident. Though the P.W.2 has further stated that, 6\nmonths prior to the accident, his deceased son was working in the\nsaid Company and they have no hurdle to examine the employer\nof his deceased son, the Petitioners did not care to examine the\nemployer of the said deceased. Hence, the income of the said\n SCCH-7                          58                MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\ndeceased, which is of Rupees 15,928/- p.m., as stated by the\nP.W.2 cannot be taken into for consideration. However, at the time\nof accident, the deceased was 22 years and he has passed SSLC\nand he was having Petitioners as his parents, by considering the\nsame, this Tribunal feels that, it is just, proper and necessary to\nconsider the notional income of the deceased is of Rupees 9,000/-\np.m., at the time of accident. Hence, the notional income of the\ndeceased is considered as Rupees 9,000/- p.m., at the time of\naccident.\n\n\n     62.    The P.W.2 has stated that, at the time of accident, his\nson deceased Mohammed Junaid was hale, healthy and hard\nworking and was having bright future and further his son was\nsupporting his family financially and due to the death of his son in\nthe said accident, they are finding extremely difficult to eake out\ntheir livelihood and they are put heavy financial stress and\nfurther, they are put to untold misery, financial loss, mental agony\nand hardship due to the tragic death of their son in the said\naccident.\n\n\n     63.    While answering Issue No.1, this Tribunal has already\nobserved and come to the conclusion that, the Petitioners are the\nlegal representatives and the Petitioner No.2 is a dependent upon\nthe said deceased. While answering Issue No.2, this Tribunal has\nalready observed and come to the conclusion that, the entire\nnegligence is on the part of the deceased driver, namely, Yasir\nKhan S/o. Nasir Khan in the commission of the said road traffic\naccident, who was driving the offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car\n SCCH-7                             59                 MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nbearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825 and he and the said\noffending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car are very much involved in the\nsaid road traffic accident, wherein, the deceased, Mohammed\nJunid, who was traveling in the said offending Car at the time of\naccident had sustained grievous injuries on his head and all over\nthe body and died on the accidental spot including the said driver.\nHence, the Petitioners No.1 and 2 being the legal representatives\nand the Petitioner No.2 being a dependent upon the said\ndeceased, are entitled for compensation under the following heads.\n\n\n    64.     As per the decision reported in 2013 ACJ 1403\n(Rajesh and Others V/s. Rajbir Singh and Others) and as the\ndeceased was aged 22 years at the time of accident, towards\nfuture prospects 50% of the income has to be added. So, 50% of\nRupees 9,000/- comes to Rupees 4,500/-. Therefore, the income\nof the deceased comes to Rupees 13,500/- p.m. (Rs.9,000/- +\n4,500/-).\n\n\n    65.     The Petitioner No.2 is considered as a dependent of the\ndeceased. Therefore, deceased left behind one dependent. As per\nthe principles laid down in ILR 2012 KAR 2859 (New India\nAssurance Co.

Therefore, loss of dependency comes to Rupees\n SCCH-7                            60                   MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\n6,750/- (Rs.13,500/- (-) Rs.6,750/-). The multiplier corresponding\nto the age of the deceased, i.e., 22 years, is 18 as per Sarala\nVarma&#x27;s Case. Therefore, loss of dependency comes to Rupees\n14,58,000/- (Rs.6,750/- x 12 x 18). Therefore, the Petitioners are\nentitled for Rupees 14,58,000/- towards loss of dependency due to\ndeath of Mohammed Junaid S/o Mohammed Syed.\n\n\n      66.   The P.W.2 has stated that, due to the accident, they\nwere made to spent Rupees 50,000/- towards the funeral\nceremony and such other expenses of their son. In this regard, the\nPetitioners have not produced any scrap of paper.\n\n\n      67.   As per the principles laid down in the decision reported\nin 2013 ACJ 1403 (Rajesh and Others V/s.

Nasir\n SCCH-7                                67                        MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nKhan in the commission of the said road traffic accident, who was\ndriving the offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing Registration\nNo.KA-03-ML-9825 and he and the said offending Maruthi Swift\nDzire Car are very much involved in the said road traffic accident,\nwherein, the deceased Syed Ayub Pasha, Mohammed Junid,\nMayur Sharma and Yarab Abbas, who were traveling in the said\noffending Car at the time of accident had sustained grievous\ninjuries on their head and all over the body and died on the\naccidental spot including the said driver. It is clearly mentioned by\nthe respective Petitioners in the cause title of the petitions that,\nthe Respondent No.1 is an Owner and the Respondent No.2 is an\nInsurer of the offending Maruthi Swift Dzire Car bearing\nRegistration No.KA-03-ML-9825 and the Respondent No.3 is a\ndriver and the Respondent No.4 is the Owner of the BMTC Bus\nbearing   Registration    No.KA-01-FA-1241.               The     Petitioners      in\nM.V.C.No.1097/2014 have produced Ex.P.10 B-Register Extract\nrelating to vehicle bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9825, i.e.,\nthe offending Car. The Respondent No.2 in its written statement\nhas   clearly   stated   that,   it        has   issued    a     Policy   bearing\nNo.23112001877331011000 in respect of Maruthi Swift Dzire Car\nbearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9823 and the said policy was in\nforce from 28.01.2013 to 27.01.2014 and without prejudice to the\nconfirmation of the policy, the liability of it, if any, will be\nsubjected to the terms and conditions of the policy, verification of\nEngine and Chassis Number, the validity and the effective driving\nlicence of the rider of the vehicle and subjected to the provisions of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_33\">M.V. Act</a>. The R.W.2, who is a Manager-Legal of the\nRespondent No.2 has stated in his examination-in-chief that, the\n SCCH-7                           68               MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nthird     Respondent      had    issued     the   policy    bearing\nNo.23112001877331011000 in respect of Swift Dzire Car bearing\nRegistration No.KA-03-ML-9823 and the said policy was in force\nfrom 28.01.2013 to 27.01.2014. On perusal of the said oral\nevidence of P.W.1 to P.W.3, the contents of Ex.P.10 B-Register\nExtract, contentions taken by the Respondent No.2 in his written\nstatement and the evidence of R.W.2, it appears that, at the time\nof accident, the Respondent No.1 was a R.C. Owner and the\nRespondent No.2 was an Insurer of the offending Swift Dzire Car\nbearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9823 and its Insurance Policy\nwas valid, which covers the date of accident. It is also clear from\nthe pleadings and evidence of P.W.1 to P.W.3 that, at the time of\naccident, the R.W.3, i.e., the Respondent No.3 was a driver of the\nBMTC Bus bearing Registration No.KA-01-FA-1241. Further, there\nis no allegations leveled by the Investigating Officer in Ex.R.1\nCharge Sheet as against the deceased driver of the offending Swift\nDzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9823 that, he was\nnot having a valid and effective driving licence to drive such class\nof offending Car at the time of accident.\n\n\n        84.   But, based on the said reasons, it cannot be said and\ncome to the conclusion that, the Respondent No.1 being a R.C.\nOwner and the Respondent No.2 being an Insurer of the offending\nSwift Dzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9823 are jointly\nand severally liable to pay the compensation and interest to the all\nthe Petitioners, as, while answering Issue No.2 in all the cases,\nthis Tribunal has already observed and come to the conclusion\nthat, at the time of accident, the deceased driver of the offending\n SCCH-7                           69                   MVC.No.1095/2014\n\n\n\n\nCar was under influence of alcohol. Further, it is clearly alleged by\nthe Investigating Officer in Ex.R.1 Charge Sheet that, at the time\nof accident, the deceased driver of the offending Car was under the\ninfluence of alcohol and as such, he has inserted <a href=\"/doc/139481594/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 185</a> of\nM.V. Act along with <a href=\"/doc/1270101/\" id=\"a_35\">Sections 279</a> and <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_36\">304(A)</a> of IPC. Hence, the\nRespondent No.1 being a R.C. Owner of the said offending Swift\nDzire Car bearing Registration No.KA-03-ML-9823, is alone liable\nto pay the compensation to all the Petitioners. Hence, the petitions\nfiled by the Petitioners are liable to be allowed as against the\nRespondent No.1 and they are liable to dismissed as against the\nRespondent No.2 and 4. It is pertinent to note here that, the\npetitions filed by the Petitioners as against the Respondent No.3\nwas dismissed on 17.10.2014 as steps not taken. In view of the\nabove said reasons and findings on Issues, the principles\nenunciated in the decision cited by the Learned Counsel appearing\nfor the Petitioners are applicable to some extent. Hence, Issues\nNo.3     in   M.V.C.No.1097/2014,      M.V.C.No.1095/2014           and\nM.V.C.No.1096/2014 are answered accordingly.\n\n\n       85.
