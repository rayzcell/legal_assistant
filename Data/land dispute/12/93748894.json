Lokur, J.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">1.    Leave granted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">2.    The principal question for consideration is whether the mere  issuance\nof a notice under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/773901/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 35(3)</a> of the Indian Forest  Act,\n1927 is sufficient for any land being declared  a  “private  forest”  within\nthe meaning of that expression  as  defined  in  <a href=\"/doc/76024981/\" id=\"a_2\">Section  2(f)(iii)</a>  of  the\nMaharashtra Private Forests (Acquisition) Act, 1975.  In  our  opinion,  the\nquestion must be answered  in  the  negative.  Connected  therewith  is  the\nquestion whether the word “issued” in <a href=\"/doc/76024981/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 2(f) (iii)</a> of the  Maharashtra\nPrivate Forests Acquisition Act, 1975 read with <a href=\"/doc/1344234/\" id=\"a_4\">Section  35</a>  of  the  Indian\nForest Act, 1927 must be given a literal interpretation or a broad  meaning.\n In our opinion the word must be given a broad meaning  in  the  surrounding\ncontext in which it is used.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">3.    A tertiary question that arises is, assuming the  disputed  lands  are\nforest  lands,  can  the  State  be  allowed   to   demolish   the   massive\nconstructions made thereon over the last half a  century.  Given  the  facts\nand circumstances of these appeals, our answer to this question is  also  in\nthe negative.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">4.    This is a batch of 20 appeals and they were argued  on  the  basis  of\nthe facts as in the appeal of Godrej. In each  appeal,  the  minute  details\nwould, of course, be different but the legal issues are  the  same  and  all\nthe appeals were argued by learned counsel  on  the  basis  that  the  legal\nissues and questions of law are the same. For  convenience,  we  have  taken\ninto consideration the facts in the appeal of Godrej.\nFacts\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">5.    Godrej acquired land in Vikhroli in Salsette taluka in Maharashtra  by\na registered deed of conveyance dated 30th July 1948 from Nowroji  Pirojsha,\nsuccessor in interest of Framjee Cawasjee Banaji  who,  in  turn,  had  been\ngiven a perpetual lease/kowl for the land by the  Government  of  Bombay  on\n7th July 1835.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">6.    The land was described in the perpetual  lease/kowl  as  “waste  land”\nand one of the purposes of the lease was to cultivate  the  waste  land.  We\nare concerned in this appeal with an area of 133 acres  and  38  gunthas  of\nland bearing Old Survey Nos. 117,118 and 120 (New Survey Nos. 36 (Part),  37\nand 38).  For convenience this land is hereafter referred as  the  “disputed\nland”.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">Consent decree in the Bombay High Court\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">7.    On 27th August 1951 the Legislative Assembly of the  State  of  Bombay\npassed the <a href=\"/doc/66889874/\" id=\"a_5\">Salsette Estates (Land Revenue Exemption  Abolition)  Act,  1951</a>.\nThis statute was brought into force on 1st March 1952.   Section  4  of  the\nSalsette Estates Act provided that waste lands  granted  under  a  perpetual\nlease/kowl not appropriated or brought under cultivation before 14th  August\n1951 shall vest in and be the property of the State.[1]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">8.    According to the State, the disputed  land  was  not  appropriated  or\nbrought under cultivation before 14th August 1951 and, therefore, it  vested\nin or was the property of the State by virtue of Section 4 of  the  Salsette\nEstates Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">9.    This factual position was  disputed  by  Godrej  and  to  resolve  the\ndispute, Suit No. 413 of 1953 was filed by Godrej in the Bombay  High  Court\npraying, inter alia, for  a  declaration  that  it  was  the  owner  of  the\ndisputed land in village Vikhroli as  the  successor  in  title  of  Framjee\nCawasjee Banaji; that the provisions of the  Salsette  Estates  Act  had  no\napplication to the disputed land  and,  that  the  disputed  land  had  been\nappropriated  by  Godrej  before  14th  August  1951  for   its   industrial\nundertaking.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">10.   The suit was contested by the State by filing a written statement  but\neventually the Bombay High Court passed a  consent  decree  on  8th  January\n1962 to the effect that except for an area of 31 gunthas,  all  other  lands\nwere appropriated and  brought  under  cultivation  by  Godrej  before  14th\nAugust 1951 and are the property of Godrej. The consent decree reads,  inter\nalia, as follows:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           “AND THIS COURT by and with such  consent  DOTH  FUTHER  DECLARE\n           that it is agreed by and between the parties  of  the  following\n           lands namely\n           S. No.                            Area\n                                             A.G.A.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           15 Part                           0-21-0\n           16 Part                           0-10-0\n                                             0-31-0\n\n           in the village of Vikhroli vest in Government under <a href=\"/doc/1169217/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 4(c)</a>\n           of the said Act” [Salsette Estates Act].\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">           “AND THIS COURT by and with such consent  DOTH  FURTHER  DECLARE\n           that it is agreed by and  between  the  parties  that  save  and\n           except the lands mentioned above all other lands in the  village\n           of Vikhroli  were  appropriated  or  brought  under  cultivation\n           before the fourteenth day of August one  thousand  nine  hundred\n           and fifty-one and are the property of the Plaintiff….”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">11.   These events establish two facts: (i) Even  according  to  the  State,\nthe disputed land was ‘waste land’ and not a ‘forest’. This  is  significant\nsince the <a href=\"/doc/654536/\" id=\"a_7\">Indian Forest Act, 1927</a> did not apply to ‘waste land’ (due to  the\n<a href=\"/doc/182063556/\" id=\"a_8\">Indian Forest (Bombay Amendment) Act, 1948</a>) with effect  from  4th  December\n1948. (ii) It was acknowledged by the State that the disputed land (even  if\nit was a forest) was appropriated or brought  under  cultivation  by  Godrej\nbefore 14th August 1951.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">Development Plan for the City of Bombay\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">12.   A development  plan  for  the  City  of  Bombay  (and  Greater  Bombay\nincluding  Vikhroli)  was  published  on  7th  January  1967  and  the  next\ndevelopment plan was published in  1991.  In  both  development  plans,  the\ndisputed land was designated as ‘R’ or ‘Residential’. On publication of  the\nfirst development plan, Godrej applied for and was  granted  permission,  on\nvarious dates, by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay  to  construct\nresidential buildings  on  the  disputed  land.   Godrej  is  said  to  have\nconstructed four such buildings on the basis  of  permissions  granted  from\ntime to time and these building were occupied for  residential  purposes  by\nits staff.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">13.   On 17th February 1976 the <a href=\"/doc/1005850/\" id=\"a_9\">Urban Land  (Ceiling  and  Regulation)  Act,\n1976</a> came into force. Since the disputed land was in excess of  the  ceiling\nlimit, Godrej filed statements (under <a href=\"/doc/1144416/\" id=\"a_10\">Section  6</a>  of  the  Act)  and  sought\nexemption from the Competent  Authority  for  utilizing  the  excess/surplus\nvacant lands for industrial and residential purposes (under  <a href=\"/doc/729813/\" id=\"a_11\">Section  20</a>  of\nthe Act). Pursuant to the request made by Godrej, it was  granted  exemption\nby the State Government, as prayed for and  subject  to  certain  conditions\nwhich included (both  initially  and  subsequently  by  a  corrigendum)  the\nconstruction of tenements for the benefit of its employees  to  be  used  as\nstaff quarters.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">14.   Pursuant to the  grant  of  exemption,  Godrej  applied  for  and  was\ngranted permission  by  the  Municipal  Corporation  of  Greater  Bombay  to\nconstruct multi-storeyed  buildings  on  the  disputed  land.  According  to\nGodrej, over a period of time,  it  has  constructed  more  than  40  multi-\nstoreyed residential buildings (ground+4 and ground+7), one club  house  and\nfive electric sub-stations. It is  said  that  over  a  couple  of  thousand\nfamilies are occupying these buildings and  that  further  construction  has\nalso been made, pursuant to permission granted, of  a  management  institute\nand other residential buildings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">Amendments to the Indian Forest Act, 1927\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">15.   <a href=\"/doc/654536/\" id=\"a_12\">Chapter V of the Indian Forest Act, 1927</a> relates to the  control  over\nforests and lands not being the property of government.  It was amended  (as\nfar as we are concerned) on three  occasions  by  the  State  of  Bombay  or\nMaharashtra, as the case may be.[2]\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">16.   The first amendment was by the <a href=\"/doc/182063556/\" id=\"a_13\">Indian Forest (Bombay  Amendment)  Act,\n1948</a> being <a href=\"/doc/8438375/\" id=\"a_14\">Bombay Act</a> No. 62 of 1948. By this  amendment  (which  came  into\nforce on 4th December 1948), the  three  significant  changes  that  we  are\nconcerned with were: (i) Insertion of  Section  34A  in  the  <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_15\">Forest  Act</a>[3]\nwhereby an  inclusive  definition  of  “forest”  was  incorporated  for  the\npurposes of the chapter; (ii) Substitution of <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 35(1)</a>  of  the  Forest\nAct[4] dealing with protection of forests for  special  purposes,  including\nregulatory and prohibitory  measures;  (iii)  The  words  ‘waste  lands’  or\n‘land’ occurring in sub-sections (2) and (3) of <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_17\">Section  35</a>  of  the  Forest\nAct[5] were deleted.   Therefore,  ‘waste  lands’  were  taken  out  of  the\npurview of the <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_18\">Forest Act</a> (as  applicable  to  the  State  of  Bombay)  with\neffect from 4th December 1948.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">17.   The next amendment was made by the <a href=\"/doc/100956305/\" id=\"a_19\">Indian  Forest  (Bombay  Amendment)\nAct, 1955</a> being <a href=\"/doc/8438375/\" id=\"a_20\">Bombay Act</a> No. 24 of 1955.  The  three  significant  changes\nthat we are concerned with were: (i) Amendment  to  <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_21\">Section  35(3)</a>  of   the\nForest Act;[6] (ii) Insertion  of sub-sections (4),\n\n(5) and (6) in <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 35</a> of the Forest Act;[7] (iii) Insertion  of  Section\n36A (manner of serving notice and order under  Section  36)  in  the  <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_23\">Forest\nAct</a>.[8]\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">18.   The next amendment was by the <a href=\"/doc/38255616/\" id=\"a_24\">Indian Forest  (Maharashtra  Unification\nand Amendment) Act, 1960</a> being <a href=\"/doc/4377279/\" id=\"a_25\">Maharashtra  Act</a>  No.  6  of  1961.  The  two\nchanges brought about were: (i) The words “six months”  in  sub-section  (4)\nof <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 35</a> of  the  Forest  Act  were  substituted  by  the   words  “one\nyear”;[9]  (ii) Sub-sections (5A) and  (7) were inserted in  <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_27\">Section  35</a>  of\nthe Forest Act.[10]\nNotice issued to Godrej\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">19.   Completely unknown to Godrej and not disclosed by the  State  in  Suit\nNo. 413 of 1953 even till 8th January  1962  when  the  consent  decree  was\npassed by the Bombay High Court, a Notice bearing No. WT/53 had been  issued\nto Godrej under <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 35(3)</a> of the Forest Act (as amended)  and  published\nin the Bombay Government Gazette of 6th September 1956  in  respect  of  the\ndisputed land in village Vikhroli. Godrej subsequently learnt of the  notice\nfrom a search in the records of  the  Department  of  Archives.

The constitutional validity of  the  Private  Forests  Act  (including\n<a href=\"/doc/102921595/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 3</a> thereof) was challenged in the Bombay High Court on the ground  of\nlegislative competence of the State Legislature to enact the  statute.

The notice was  served\non him on 12th September 1975.  In the meanwhile, the  Private  Forests  Act\ncame into force on 30th August 1975.   Chintamani  raised  a  dispute  under\nSection 6 of the Private Forests Act (as postulated in Waghmare)  contending\nthat his land was not a forest and did not vest in the  State  in  terms  of\nSection 3 of the Private Forests Act.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">30.

However,  this  Court  went  into  a  further  question,\nnamely, whether the mere issuance of a notice under  <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_79\">Section  35(3)</a>  of  the\nForest Act per se attracted Section 2(f)(iii) of the  Private  Forests  Act.\nThis Court noticed (in paragraph 18  of  the  Report)  that  where  a  final\nnotification is issued under <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 35(1)</a>  of  the  Forest  Act  (obviously\nafter hearing the objections of  the  land  owner  in  compliance  with  the\nrequirements of Section 35(3) thereof), the entire land of  the  land  owner\nwould automatically vest in the State on the appointed date, that  is,  30th\nAugust 1975 when the Private Forests Act came into force. In  such  a  case,\nthe land owner would, ex hypothesi have an opportunity  of  showing  in  the\nobjections to the Section 35(3) notice that the land is not  a  ‘forest’  as\ndefined under <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 34A</a> of the Forest Act.  If the  land  owner  succeeded\nin so showing, then clearly a final notification under <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 35(1)</a> of  the\nForest Act could not be issued. But if the land owner did not succeed in  so\nshowing, only then could a final notification under  <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_83\">Section  35(1)</a>  of  the\nForest Act be issued. It must be recalled, at this  stage,  that  the  words\n“or land” under <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 35(3)</a> of the Forest Act  had  been  deleted  by  the\n<a href=\"/doc/182063556/\" id=\"a_85\">Indian Forest (Bombay Amendment) Act, 1948</a> being <a href=\"/doc/8438375/\" id=\"a_86\">Bombay Act</a>  No.62  of  1948\nand, additionally therefore, such  an  objection  could  validly  have  been\nraised.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">31.   Consequently, the situation that presented itself  in  Chintamani  was\nthat though a notice was issued to the land owner  under  <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_87\">Section  35(3)</a>  of\nthe Forest Act before 30th August 1975, it could not be decided before  that\ndate when the Private Forests Act  came  into  force.  (Such  a  notice  was\nreferred to as a ‘pipeline notice’  by  Mr.  F.S.  Nariman).   Clearly,  the\nrecipient of a pipeline notice would be entitled to the benefit of  Waghmare\nbut this seems  to  have  been  overlooked  by  this  Court  in  Chintamani.\nHowever, to mitigate the hardship to a pipeline noticee  who  is  not  given\nthe benefit of Waghmare this Court read Section  2(f)(iii)  of  the  Private\nForests Act and observed (perhaps as a sop  to  the  land  owner)  that  the\n“Maharashtra Legislature thought that the entire  property  covered  by  the\nnotice in the State need not vest but it excluded  2  hectares  out  of  the\nforest land held by the landholder.  That  was  the  consideration  for  not\nallowing the benefit of an inquiry under Section 35(3) and for not  allowing\nthe notification to be issued under Section 35(1) of the 1927 Act”.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">32.   It is in this background that this Court narrowly construed the  words\n“a notice has been issued under sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_88\">section 35</a> of the  Forest\nAct” occurring in Section 2(f)(iii)  of  the  Private  Forests  Act  as  not\nrequiring “service of such notice before 30-8-1975, nor for an  inquiry  nor\nfor a notification under Section 35(1).”[14]\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">33.   In a sense, therefore,  not  only  is  there  a  difference  of  views\nbetween Waghmare and Chintamani but Chintamani  has  gone  much  further  in\ntaking away the right of a landholder.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">Proceedings in the High Court\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_52\">34.   On or about 24th May  2006,  Godrej  received  six  stop-work  notices\nissued  by  the  concerned  Assistant  Engineer  of  the  Bombay   Municipal\nCorporation stating that the Deputy Conservator  of  Forests,  Thane  Forest\nDivision, by a letter dated 8th May 2006  had  informed  that  the  disputed\nland was “affected” by the reservation of a private forest and therefore  no\nconstruction could be carried out therein  without  the  permission  of  the\nCentral Government under the <a href=\"/doc/1436914/\" id=\"a_89\">Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_53\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1724514\" id=\"span_3\">35.   On enquiries made by Godrej subsequent to the  receipt  of  the  stop-\nwork notices, it came to be known that the Bombay High  Court  had  given  a\ndirection on 22nd June 2005 in PIL No. 17/2002  (<a href=\"/doc/1724514/\" id=\"a_90\">Bombay  Environment  Action\nGroup v. State of Maharashtra</a>) on the claim of the petitioner  therein  that\nin the entire State of Maharashtra the land records were  incomplete  and  a\nlarge number of problems were encountered because of not updating  the  land\nrecords  which  in  any  event  is  also  an  obligation   on   the   State.\nAccordingly, the High Court gave a direction granting time to the  State  of\nMaharashtra up to 31st May 2006 to complete the entire land records  in  the\nState and further directed that quarterly reports regarding the progress  of\nthe work be filed before the Registrar General of the High Court.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">36.   Godrej learnt that this triggered an ex parte mutation of the  revenue\nrecords by the State to show that the disputed land was  ‘affected’  by  the\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/120838106/\" id=\"a_91\">Private Forest Act</a>. Godrej also  learnt  that  the  Notice\nNo. WT/53 (referred to above) had been published in  the  Bombay  Government\nGazette of 6th September 1956, but not served on it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">37.   On these broad facts, Godrej filed Writ Petition No. 2196 of  2006  in\nthe Bombay High Court praying, inter alia, for a declaration that the  lands\nowned by it in village Vikhroli are not forest land; that the  letter  dated\n8th May 2006 issued by the Deputy Conservator of Forest as well as six stop-\nwork notices dated 24th May 2006 be declared as illegal, ab initio null  and\nvoid and that the mutation in the revenue records be also declared  illegal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">38.   During the proceedings in the High Court it  came  to  be  known  that\nabout 170 notices similar to notice No. WT/53 had  been  issued  to  various\nparties in 1956-57, including to the Bhabha Atomic Energy  Complex  and  the\nEmployees State Insurance Scheme Hospital.  However,  the  lands  of  Bhabha\nAtomic Energy Complex and the  Employees  State  Insurance  Scheme  Hospital\nwere not touched by the State.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">39.   The writ petition (along with several other  similar  writ  petitions)\nwas contested by the State and it was submitted inter alia that in  view  of\nthe judgment of this Court in Chintamani, the disputed land stood vested  in\nthe State in terms of  Section  3  of  the  Private  Forests  Act.   By  the\nimpugned order dated 24th March 2008, the High Court dismissed all the  writ\npetitions. Among other things, it was held in paragraph 152 of the  impugned\njudgment:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">           “In the light of the authoritative pronouncement in Chintamani&#x27;s\n           case we see no substance in the argument that  the  construction\n           activities on the land being in accordance with  the  sanctioned\n           plans and  approvals  so  also  the  lands  being  part  of  the\n           development plan and affected by <a href=\"/doc/1005850/\" id=\"a_92\">Urban Land Ceiling Act</a>, State&#x27;s\n           action impugned in these petitions is without  any  jurisdiction\n           or authority in law. All arguments with regard to  the  user  of\n           the  land  today  has  no  legal  basis.  User  today  is  after\n           development or continuing development. Once  development  is  on\n           private forest, then, the same could not have been permitted  or\n           carried out. Mere omission or inaction of the  State  Government\n           cannot  be  the  basis  for  accepting  the  arguments  of   the\n           petitioners.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">40.   The High Court rejected  the  contention  that  “mere  issuance  of  a\nnotice under Section 35(3) without any notification being published  in  the\nofficial gazette within the meaning of Section 35(1)  would  not  mean  that\nthe land is excluded from the purview of the  Private  Forest  (Acquisition)\nAct enacted by the Maharashtra Government.”[15]\n      It was also held that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">           “Once the State Government issues  such  notice  [under  <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_93\">Section\n           35(3)</a> of the Forest Act], then, the intention is  apparent.  The\n           intention is to regulate  and  prohibit  certain  activities  in\n           forest. Merely because such a notice is issued by it in 1957 and\n           1958 but it did not take necessary steps in furtherance thereof,\n           does not mean that the notices have been abandoned as  contended\n           by the petitioners. There  is  no  concept  of  &quot;abandonment  or\n           disuse&quot; in such case. Apart from the fact  that  these  concepts\n           could not be imported in a modern statute, we are  of  the  view\n           that they cannot be  imported  and  read  into  statute  of  the\n           present nature. Statutes which  are  meant  for  protecting  and\n           preserving forests and achieve larger public interest, cannot be\n           construed narrowly as contended. The interpretation,  therefore,\n           if at all there is any ambiguity or scope for  construction  has\n           to be wider and sub-serving this public  interest  so  also  the\n           intent and object in enacting them. The  reason  for  the  State\n           Government not being able to pursue the measures for  preserving\n           and protecting the forest wealth is obvious.”[16]\n\n      Further, it was held that:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">           “The Development Plan proposal and designation so also the  user\n           cannot conflict with the character of  the  land  as  a  private\n           forest. To accept the arguments of the  petitioners  would  mean\n           that despite vesting the private  forest  continues  as  a  land\n           covered by the development plan and being within  the  municipal\n           limits it loses its character as a  private  forest.  A  private\n           forest is a forest and upon its vesting in the State  Government\n           by virtue of the Private Forest (Acquisition) Act  would  remain\n           as such. Therefore, we see no conflict because of any change  in\n           the situation. Vesting was complete on  30th  August,  1975.  On\n           30th August, 1975 the lands with regard to which the notice  was\n           issued under Section 35(3), being a private forest vested in the\n           State, it was a private forest always and, therefore,  there  is\n           no question of the development  plan  or  any  proposal  therein\n           superimposing itself on its status.”[17]\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_59\"> 41.

As stated earlier since the records  did  not  reveal  that\n           these are acquired Private Forests the erstwhile owners went  on\n           selling these lands to several persons who also in turn went  on\n           selling them to the strangers without there being any  fault  on\n           their part.  Subsequently developers purchased these  lands  and\n           after getting requisite permissions from the Planning  Authority\n           carried on constructions thereon.   Thereafter  individuals  and\n           members of the  public  who  wanted  accommodation  for  housing\n           probably invested their lifetime savings  and/or  raising  loans\n           entered into transactions of purchasing the flats constructed on\n           these lands  without  their  fault.

We are in agreement with this view.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">48.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"533262\" id=\"span_4\">In <a href=\"/doc/533262/\" id=\"a_107\">Jagir Singh v. State of Bihar</a>[18] the interpretation  of  the  word\n“owner” in <a href=\"/doc/69019909/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 2(d)</a> of  the  Bihar  Taxation  on  Passengers  and  Goods\n(Carried  by  Public  Service  Motor  Vehicles)  Act,  1961  came   up   for\nconsideration. While interpreting  “owner”  which  ‘means’  and  ‘includes’,\nthis Court held:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">           “The definition of the term “owner” is exhaustive  and  intended\n           to extend the meaning of the term by including within its  sweep\n           bailee of a public carrier vehicle  or  any  manager  acting  on\n           behalf of the owner. The intention of the legislature to  extend\n           the meaning of the term by the definition given by  it  will  be\n           frustrated if what is intended to be inclusive is interpreted to\n           exclude the actual owner.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1704157\" id=\"span_5\">49.    The  proposition  was  more  clearly  articulated  in  <a href=\"/doc/1704157/\" id=\"a_109\">Black  Diamond\nBeverages v. Commercial Tax Officer</a>[19] wherein this  Court  considered  the\nuse of the words ‘means’ and ‘includes’ in the definition  of  “sale  price”\nin Section 2(d) of the W.B. Sales Tax Act, 1954. It was held in paragraph  7\nof the Report:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">           “The first part of the definition defines  the  meaning  of  the\n           word “sale price” and must, in our view, be given its  ordinary,\n           popular or natural meaning. The interpretation thereof is in  no\n           way controlled or affected by the second part  which  “includes”\n           certain other things in the definition. This is  a  well-settled\n           principle of construction.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">50.   In coming to this conclusion, this Court referred to  a  passage  from\nCraies on Statute Law[20] which in turn referred to  the  following  passage\nfrom Robinson v. Barton-Eccles Local Board[21]:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">           “An interpretation clause of this kind is not meant  to  prevent\n           the word receiving its  ordinary,  popular,  and  natural  sense\n           whenever that would be properly applicable, but  to  enable  the\n           word as used in the Act … to be applied to something to which it\n           would not ordinarily be applicable.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">51.   In the case of Godrej, the  admitted  position,  as  per  the  consent\ndecree dated 8th January 1962 is that the disputed  land  was  not  a  waste\nland nor was it a forest. In so far as the other appeals are concerned,  the\ndisputed lands were built upon, from time to  time,  either  for  industrial\npurposes or for commercial purposes or for residential purposes.  Under  the\ncircumstances, by no stretch of imagination can  it  be  said  that  any  of\nthese disputed lands are ‘forest’ within the primary meaning of  that  word,\nor even within the extended meaning given in <a href=\"/doc/165006834/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 2</a>(c-i) of  the  Private\nForests Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">52.   The next question is whether the notice said to have  been  issued  to\nGodrej being Notice No. WT/53 can  be  described  as  a  ‘pipeline  notice’.\nAgain, the answer must be in the  negative  in  as  much  as  it  cannot  be\nreasonably  said  that  the  pipeline  extends  from  1956-57  up  to  1975.\nAssuming that a notice issued in 1956-57 is a pipeline notice even in  1975,\nthe question before us  would,  nevertheless,  relate  to  the  meaning  and\nimpact of “issued” of Section 2(f)(iii) of  the  Private  Forests  Act  read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 35</a> of the Forest Act.  This is really the meat of  the  matter.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">53.   Undoubtedly, the first rule of interpretation is that the words  in  a\nstatute must be interpreted literally. But at the same time if  the  context\nin which a word is used and the provisions of a statute  inexorably  suggest\na subtext other than literal, then the context becomes important.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">54.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"538117\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1144327\" id=\"span_7\">In <a href=\"/doc/1144327/\" id=\"a_112\">R.L.

Applying the law <a href=\"/doc/136856/\" id=\"a_115\">laid down by</a> this Court  on  interpretation,  in  the\ncontext of these appeals, we may be missing the wood  for  the  trees  if  a\nliteral meaning is given  to  the  word  “issued”.  To  avoid  this,  it  is\nnecessary to also appreciate the scheme of <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_116\">Section  35</a>  of  the  Forest  Act\nsince that scheme needs to be kept in mind  while  considering  “issued”  in\nSection 2(f)(iii) of the Private Forests Act.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\"> 56.  A notice under <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 35(3)</a> of the Forest Act is intended to give  an\nopportunity to the owner of a forest  to  show  cause  why,  inter  alia,  a\nregulatory or a prohibitory measure be not made in respect of  that  forest.\nIt is important to note that such a notice pre-supposes the existence  of  a\nforest. The owner of the forest is expected  to  file  objections  within  a\nreasonable time as specified in the notice and is also given an  opportunity\nto  lead  evidence  in  support  of  the  objections.  After   these   basic\nrequirements are met, the owner of the forest is entitled to  a  hearing  on\nthe objections. This entire procedure obviously cannot be  followed  by  the\nState and the owner of the forest  unless  the  owner  is  served  with  the\nnotice. Therefore, service of a notice issued under  <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_118\">Section  35(3)</a>  of  the\nForest Act is inherent in the very language used in the  provision  and  the\nvery purpose of the provision.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">57.   Additionally, <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 35(4)</a> of the Forest Act provides that  a  notice\nunder <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 35(3)</a> of the Forest Act may provide  that  for  a  period  not\nexceeding six months (extended to one year in 1961) the owner of the  forest\ncan be obliged to adhere to one or more of  the  regulatory  or  prohibitory\nmeasures mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 35(1)</a> of the Forest Act.  On  the  failure  of\nthe owner of the forest to abide by the said measures, he/she is  liable  to\nimprisonment for a term upto six months and/or a fine  under  <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_122\">Section  35(7)</a>\nof the Forest Act. Surely, given the penal consequence of  non-adherence  to\na Section 35(4) direction in a Section  35(3)  notice,  service  of  such  a\nnotice must be interpreted to be mandatory. On the  facts  of  the  case  in\nGodrej, such a direction was in fact given and Godrej was  directed,  for  a\nperiod of six months, to refrain from the cutting and removal of  trees  and\ntimber and  the  firing  and  clearing  of  vegetation.  Strictly  speaking,\ntherefore, despite not being  served  with  Notice  No.  WT/53  and  despite\nhaving no knowledge of it, Godrej was liable to be  punished  under  <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_123\">Section\n35(7)</a> of the Forest Act if it cut or removed any tree or timber or fired  or\ncleared any vegetation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">58.   This interplay may be looked at from another point  of  view,  namely,\nthe need to issue a direction under <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 35(4)</a> of the Forest  Act,  which\ncan be only to prevent damage to or destruction of a forest. If  the  notice\nunder <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 35(3)</a> of the Forest Act is not served  on  the  owner  of  the\nforest, he/she may continue to damage the forest defeating the very  purpose\nof the <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_126\">Forest Act</a>. Such an interpretation cannot be given to <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_127\">Section  35</a>  of\nthe Forest Act nor can  a  limited  interpretation  be  given  to  the  word\n“issued” used in the context of <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 35</a> of  the  Forest  Act  in  Section\n2(f)(iii) of the Private Forests Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">59.   Finally, <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 35(5)</a> of the Forest Act mandates not only service  of\na notice issued under that provision “in the manner provided in <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_130\">the Code  of\nCivil Procedure</a>, 1908, for the service of summons” (a  manner  that  we  are\nall familiar with) but also its publication “in  the  manner  prescribed  by\nrules”. This double pronged receipt and confirmation  of  knowledge  of  the\nshow cause notice by the owner of a  forest  makes  it  clear  that  <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_131\">Section\n35(3)</a> of the Forest Act is not intended to end the  process  with  the  mere\nissuance of a notice but it also requires service of a notice on  the  owner\nof the forest. The need for ensuring  service  is  clearly  to  protect  the\ninterests of the owner of the forest who may have valid reasons not only  to\nobject to the issuance of regulatory or prohibitory directions, but to  also\nenable him/her to raise a jurisdictional issue that the land in question  is\nactually not a forest. The need for ensuring  service  is  also  to  prevent\ndamage to or destruction of a forest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">60.  Unfortunately, Chintamani missed these finer  details  because  it  was\nperhaps not brought to the notice of this  Court  that  <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_132\">Section  35</a>  of  the\nForest Act as applicable  to  the  State  of  Maharashtra  had  sub-sections\nbeyond sub-section (3). This Court proceeded on the basis of <a href=\"/doc/1344234/\" id=\"a_133\">Section  35</a>  of\nthe Indian Forest Act, 1927  as  it  existed  without  being  aware  of  the\namendments made by the State of  Maharashtra  and  the  erstwhile  State  of\nBombay. This, coupled with the factually incorrect view  that  two  hectares\nof forest land[25] were excluded for the benefit of the landholder led  this\nCourt to give a restrictive meaning to “issue”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">61.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1615406\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"47384\" id=\"span_11\">In Chintamani this Court relied on the decision  rendered  in  <a href=\"/doc/47384/\" id=\"a_134\">CIT  v.\nBababhai Pitamberdas (HUF</a>)[26] to conclude that a word has to  be  construed\nin the context in which it is used in a statute  and  that,  therefore,  the\ndecisions rendered in <a href=\"/doc/1615406/\" id=\"a_135\">Banarsi Debi v. ITO</a>[27] and CWT v. Kundan  Lal  Behari\nLal[28] to  the  effect  that  “the  word  ‘issue’  has  been  construed  as\namounting to ‘service’ are not relevant for interpreting the  word  ‘issued’\nused in <a href=\"/doc/39854981/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 2(f)</a> [of the Private Forests Act].” It is true, as  observed\nabove, that a word has to be construed in the context in which  it  is  used\nin a statute. By making a reference in  Section  2(f)(iii)  of  the  Private\nForests Act to ‘issue’ in <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 35</a> of the Forest Act,  it  is  clear  that\nthe word is dressed in borrowed robes. Once that is appreciated (and it  was\nunfortunately  overlooked  in  Chintamani)  then  it  is  quite  clear  that\n‘issued’ in Section 2(f)(iii)  of  the  Private  Forests  Act  must  include\nservice of the show cause notice as postulated in <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 35</a> of  the  Forest\nAct.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">62.   We have no option, under these circumstances,  but  to  hold  that  to\nthis extent, Chintamani was incorrectly decided and it is overruled to  this\nextent.  We may add that in Chintamani the land in  question  was  factually\nheld to be a private forest and therefore the subsequent discussion was  not\nat all necessary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">63.   Assuming that the word ‘issued’ as occurring in Section  2(f)(iii)  of\nthe Private Forests Act must be literally and strictly construed, can it  be\nseriously argued that it also has reference to a show  cause  notice  issued\nunder <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_139\">Section 35(3)</a> of the Forest Act at any given time (say in 1927  or  in\n1957)? Or would it be more reasonable to hold that it  has  reference  to  a\nshow cause notice issued in somewhat closer proximity  to  the  coming  into\nforce of the Private Forests Act, or a  ‘pipeline  notice’  as  Mr.  Nariman\nputs it?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">64.   In the absence of any time period having been specified  for  deciding\na show cause notice issued under <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 35</a> of the Forest Act,  it  must  be\npresumed that it must be decided within a reasonable time.  Quite  recently,\nin Ramlila Maidan Incident, In re[29] it was held: “It is a settled rule  of\nlaw that wherever provision of a statute does not  provide  for  a  specific\ntime, the same has to be done within a  reasonable  time.  Again  reasonable\ntime cannot have a fixed connotation. It must  depend  upon  the  facts  and\ncircumstances of a given case.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"966542\" id=\"span_12\">65.   Similarly, in <a href=\"/doc/966542/\" id=\"a_141\">Mansaram v. S.P.

Balasaheb   Tukaram\nShevale</a>[31] it was held:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">           “It seems to be fairly  settled  that  if  a  statute  does  not\n           prescribe the time-limit for exercise of  revisional  power,  it\n           does not mean that such power can  be  exercised  at  any  time;\n           rather it should be exercised within a reasonable time.

According to the State, a show cause notice was issued  to  Godrej  in\n1957 (and assuming it was served) but no decision  was  taken  thereon  till\n1975 that is for about 18 years.  This  is  an  unusually  long  period  and\nundoubtedly much more than a reasonable time had elapsed  for  enabling  the\nState to take a decision on the show cause notice. Therefore, following  the\nlaw <a href=\"/doc/657146/\" id=\"a_143\">laid down by</a> this Court, the show cause notice  must,  for  all  intents\nand purposes be treated as having become a dead letter and the seed  planted\nby the State yielded nothing.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">67.   The entire problem may also be looked at from the perspective  of  the\ncitizen rather than only from the perspective of the State. No  citizen  can\nreasonably be told after almost half a century  that  he/she  was  issued  a\nshow cause notice (which was probably not served)  and  based  on  the  show\ncause notice his/her land was declared a private forest about three  decades\nago and that it vests in the State. Is it  not  the  responsibility  of  the\nState to ensure that its laws are implemented with reasonable  dispatch  and\nis it not the duty of the State to appreciate that  statute  books  are  not\nmeant to be thrown at a citizen whenever and wherever some official  decides\nto do so? Basic principles of good governance  must  be  followed  by  every\nmember of the Executive branch  of  the  State  at  all  times  keeping  the\ninterests of all citizens in mind as also the larger public interest.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">68.   In our opinion, the failure of the State to take any decision  on  the\nshow cause notice for several decades (assuming it was served on Godrej)  is\nindicative of its desire to not act on it. This opinion is  fortified  by  a\nseries of events that have taken place  between  1957  and  2006,  beginning\nwith the consent decree of 8th January 1962 in Suit No. 413 of 1953  whereby\nthe disputed land was recognized as not being  forest  land;  permission  to\nconstruct a large number of buildings (both residential  and  otherwise)  as\nper the Development Plans of 1967 and then of 1991;  exemptions  granted  by\nthe Competent Authority under the <a href=\"/doc/1005850/\" id=\"a_144\">Urban Land (Ceiling and  Regulation)  Act,\n1976</a> leading to Godrej making unhindered but permissible constructions;  and\nfinally, the absence of any attempt by the State to take possession  of  the\n‘forest land’ under Section 5 of the Private Forests Act  for  a  couple  of\ndecades. The  subsequent  event  of  the  State  moving  an  application  in\nGodavarman virtually denying the  existence  of  a  private  forest  on  the\ndisputed land also indicates that the State had come to terms  with  reality\nand was grudgingly prepared to accept that, even if the  law  permitted,  it\nwas now too late  to  remedy  the  situation.  This  view  was  emphatically\nreiterated by the Central Empowered Committee in its report dated 13th  July\n2009.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">69.   In its written submissions, the Bombay Environment  Action  Group  has\nalleged collusion between Godrej and  other  appellants  and  the  State  of\nMaharashtra to defeat the purpose of the Private Forests Act. It  is  stated\nthat prior to the said Act coming into force, the Secretary in  the  Revenue\nand Forests Department of the State Government had written to the  Collector\non 27th August 1975 enclosing a copy of the  said  Act  and  informing  that\nunder <a href=\"/doc/110713079/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 5</a> thereof,  the  Range  Forest  Officers  and  the  Divisional\nForest Officers will  be  authorized  to  take  possession  of  the  private\nforests from the land owners. It is stated that the  letter  was  issued  to\nenable the Collector to coordinate with the Divisional  Forest  Officers  to\nensure that the large private forests are taken over physically as early  as\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_91\">-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">possible. Subsequently, by another letter (variously described as dated  3rd\nFebruary 1977, 14th February 1977 and 3rd February 1979)  the  Secretary  in\nthe Revenue and Forests Department advised the Conservator of Forests to  go\nslow with the taking over of possession of private forests in Thane,  Kulaba\nand Ratnagiri districts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_93\">70.   It is difficult at this distant point of time to conclude, one way  or\nthe other, whether there was or  was  not  any  collusion  (as  alleged)  or\nwhether it was simply a case of poor  governance  by  the  State.  The  fact\nremains that  possession  of  the  disputed  land  was  not  taken  over  or\nattempted to be taken over for decades and the issue was never  raised  when\nit should have been.

State of Rajasthan</a>.[34] The same rationale would apply  to  Section\n2(f)(iii) of the Private Forests Act since it seeks to take  away,  after  a\nfew decades, private land on the ostensible ground  that  it  is  a  private\nforest. Section 2(f)(iii) of the  Private  Forests  Act  must  not  only  be\nreasonably construed but also strictly so as not to discomfit a citizen  and\nexpropriate his/her property.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_96\">73.   The fact that the Private Forests Act repealed some  sections  of  the\n<a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_150\">Forest Act</a>, particularly Sections 34A and 35 thereof  is  also  significant.\nSection 2(f)(iii) of the Private Forests Act is in a sense a  saving  clause\nfor pipeline notices issued under <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 35(3)</a> of the Forest Act but  which\ncould not, for want of adequate time be either  withdrawn  or  culminate  in\nthe issuance  of  a  regulatory  or  prohibitory  final  notification  under\n<a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 35(1)</a> of the Forest Act, depending on the objections raised  by  the\nland owner. Looked at from any point  of  view,  it  does  seem  clear  that\nSection 2(f)(iii) of the Private  Forests  Act  was  intended  to  apply  to\n‘live’ and not stale notices issued under <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 35(3)</a> of the Forest Act.\nThe second question:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"344239\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1884895\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1937304\" id=\"span_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1583107\" id=\"span_21\">74.   The next question is whether at  all  the  unstated  decision  of  the\nState  to  take  over  the  so-called  forest  land  can   be   successfully\nimplemented. What the decision implies is the  demolition,  amongst  others,\nof  a  large  number  of  residential   buildings,   industrial   buildings,\ncommercial buildings, Bhabha Atomic Energy Complex and the  Employees  State\nInsurance Scheme Hospital and compulsorily rendering homeless  thousands  of\nfamilies, some of  whom  may  have  invested  considerable  savings  in  the\ndisputed lands. What it also implies is  demolition  of  the  municipal  and\nother public infrastructure works already undertaken and  in  use,  clearing\naway the rubble  and  then  planting  trees  and  shrubs  to  ‘restore’  the\n‘forest’ to an acceptable condition. According to learned  counsel  for  the\nState, this is  easily  achievable.   But  it  is  easier  said  than  done.\nAccording to  the  Bombay  Environment  Action  Group  a  patent,  incurable\nillegality has been committed  and  the  natural  consequences  (demolition)\nmust follow.  Reliance was placed, inter  alia,  on  <a href=\"/doc/1583107/\" id=\"a_154\">K.  Ramadas  Shenoy  v.\nChief Officer</a>[35], <a href=\"/doc/1937304/\" id=\"a_155\">M.I. Builders v.

The broad principle <a href=\"/doc/344239/\" id=\"a_158\">laid down by</a>  this  Court  is  not  in  doubt.  An\nunauthorized construction, unless compoundable in law,  must  be  razed.  In\nquestion are the circumstances leading to the application of  the  principle\nand the practical application of the principle. More  often  than  not,  the\nmunicipal authorities and builders conspiratorially join hands in  violating\nthe law but the victim is an innocent purchaser or  investor  who  pays  for\nthe maladministration. In such a case, how is the victim to  be  compensated\nor is he or she expected to be the only  loser?  If  the  victim  is  to  be\ncompensated, who will do so? These issues have not  been  discussed  in  the\ndecisions cited by the Bombay Environment Action Group.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">76.   In so far as the practical application of the principle is  concerned,\nin Shenoy permission was granted to  convert  a  Kalyana  Mantap-cum-Lecture\nHall into a cinema  hall.  A  reading  of  the  decision  suggests  that  no\nconstruction was made and it is not clear whether  any  money  was  actually\nspent on the project.  The question  of  compensation,  therefore,  did  not\narise.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">77.    M.I. Builders was an extreme case in  which  partial  demolition  was\nordered since the agreement between the Lucknow  Nagar  Mahapalika  and  the\nbuilder was not only unreasonable for  the  Mahapalika,  but  atrocious.  In\nparagraph 59 of the Report, this Court said,\n           “The agreement defies logic. It is outrageous.  It  crosses  all\n           limits of rationality. The Mahapalika has certainly acted  in  a\n           fatuous manner in entering into such an agreement.”\n\n      It was further held in paragraph 71 of the Report that,\n\n           “The  agreement  smacks   of   arbitrariness,   unfairness   and\n           favouritism. The agreement was opposed to public policy. It  was\n           not in public interest. The whole process of law  was  subverted\n           to benefit the builder.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\"> 78.  Pleasant Stay Hotel was a case of deliberately flouting the law.   The\nHotel was granted sanction for the construction of two  floors  but  despite\nthe rejection of its revised plan,  it  went  ahead  and  constructed  seven\nfloors. This Court noted that, therefore, five floors had  been  constructed\nillegally and unauthorisedly. Under  these  circumstances,  and  subject  to\ncertain clarifications, the demolition order passed by the  High  Court  was\nupheld.  Payment of compensation in a case  of  knowingly  and  deliberately\nflouting the law does not arise.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\"> 79.  In Pratibha the eight unauthorized floors were  constructed  in  clear\nand flagrant violation and disregard of the FSI. The  demolition  order  had\nalready  attained  finality  in  this  Court  and  thereafter  six  of   the\nunauthorized floors had  been  demolished  and  the  seventh  was  partially\ndemolished. This Court found no justification to -\n interfere with the demolitions.   Again, the issue of compensation does not\narise in such a situation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">80.   The application of the principle <a href=\"/doc/344239/\" id=\"a_159\">laid down by</a> this  Court,  therefore,\ndepends on the independent facts found in a case. The remedy  of  demolition\ncannot be applied per se with a broad brush to all cases.   The  State  also\nseems to have realized this and that is perhaps the reason why it moved  the\napplication that it did in Godavarman.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_104\">81.   Looking at the issue from point of view of the citizen  and  not  only\nfrom the point of view of the State or a well  meaning  pressure  group,  it\ndoes appear that even though the basic principle is that  the  buyer  should\nbeware and therefore if  the  appellants  and  purchasers  of  tenements  or\ncommercial  establishments  from  the   appellants   ought   to   bear   the\nconsequences of unauthorized construction,  the  well-settled  principle  of\ncaveat emptor would  be  applicable  in  normal  circumstances  and  not  in\nextraordinary circumstances as these appeals  present,  when  a  citizen  is\neffectively led up the  garden  path   for  several  decades  by  the  State\nitself.  The\n\npresent appeals do not relate to a stray or a few instances of  unauthorized\nconstructions and, therefore, fall in a class of their own. In a  case  such\nas the present, if  a  citizen  cannot  trust  the  State  which  has  given\nstatutory permissions and provided municipal facilities, whom should  he  or\nshe trust?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">82.   Assuming the disputed land was a private forest,  the  State  remained\ncompletely inactive when construction was going on over acres and  acres  of\nland and of a very large number of buildings thereon and for a few  decades.\nThe State permitted the construction through the development  plans  and  by\ngranting exemption under the <a href=\"/doc/1005850/\" id=\"a_160\">Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation)  Act,  1976</a>\nand providing necessary  infrastructure  such  as   roads   and   sanitation\non  the disputed land and the surrounding area.  When  such  a  large  scale\nactivity involving the State is being carried  on  over  vast  stretches  of\nland exceeding a hundred acres, it is natural for a  reasonable  citizen  to\nassume that whatever actions are being taken  are  in  accordance  with  law\notherwise the State would certainly step in to prevent such  a  massive  and\nprolonged breach of the law.  The silence of the State in  all  the  appeals\nbefore us led the appellants and a large number of citizens to believe  that\nthere was no patent illegality in the constructions  on  the  disputed  land\nnor was there any legal risk in  investing  on  the  disputed  land.   Under\nthese circumstances, for the State or the Bombay  Environment  Action  Group\nto contend  that  only  the  citizen  must  bear  the  consequences  of  the\nunauthorized construction may  not  be  appropriate.   It  is  the  complete\ninaction of the State, rather  its  active  consent  that  has  resulted  in\nseveral citizens being placed in a precarious position where  they  are  now\ntold that their investment is actually in unauthorized  constructions  which\nare liable to be demolished any time even after several  decades.  There  is\nno reason why these citizens should be the only victims of such a  fate  and\nthe State be held not responsible for this state of affairs;  nor  is  there\nany reason why under such circumstances this Court should not  come  to  the\naid of victims of the  culpable  failure  of  the  State  to  implement  and\nenforce the law for several decades.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_106\">83.   In none of these cases is there  an  allegation  that  the  State  has\nacted arbitrarily or irrationally so as to voluntarily benefit  any  of  the\nappellants.  On  the  contrary,  the  facts  show  that the appellants\nfollowed the due legal process in making the  constructions  that  they  did\nand all that can be said of the State is that its Rip Van Winkleism  enabled\nthe appellants to obtain valid permissions from  various  authorities,  from\ntime to time, to make constructions over a  long  duration.  The  appellants\nand individual citizens cannot be faulted or punished for that.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">84.    These  appeals  raise  larger  issues  of  good  administration   and\ngovernance and the State has, regrettably, come out in poor  light  in  this\nregard.  It is not necessary for us to say  anything  more  on  the  subject\nexcept to conclude that even if the State  were  to  succeed  on  the  legal\nissues before us, there is no way, on the facts and circumstances  of  these\nappeals, that it can reasonably put the clock back and ensure that  none  of\nthe  persons  concerned  in  these  appeals  is  prejudiced  in  any  manner\nwhatsoever.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_108\">Conclusion:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_109\">85.
