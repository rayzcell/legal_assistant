Lease was renewable for two terms of 30 years each, and total term not to exceed 90 years. A partition suit was filed by one Prithvi Pal son of Mahavir being Suit No. 81 of 1974 in the Court of Civil Judge, Allahabad impleading Asharfi Lal son of Mewa Lal; Mrs. Shanti Devi daughter of Mewa Lal; Mrs. Ganeshia wife of Mewa Lal; Moti Lal son of Mewa Lal and Raja Ram son of Pitamber Lal as defendants-1 to 5 claiming that he has four and half annas share out of six annas i.e. 3/4 share of property in dispute i.e. Bungalow No. 23A (new number 29, Clive Road, Allahabad) and the said property be partitioned and separate possession be given to plaintiff. Suit stood decreed in terms of a compromise entered between the parties, vide judgment dated 04.04.1977 and decree dated 31.08.1977. As a result of compromise decree, name of predecessors in interest, Mewa Lal and Raja Ram was recorded in respect of Bungalow No. 23A/29A, Clive Road, Allahabad (new number 85A/25A-1, Clive Road) and petitioners have no concern with the same. Petitioners&#x27; name was recorded in respect of Bungalow No. 23/29, Clive Road, Allahabad (new number 85/29, Clive Road, Allahabad). It is also said that earlier, sons and grand-sons of Sri Sahai went in a litigation, a partition suit being Suit No. 51 of 1916 in the Court of Sub-Judge, Allahabad. In the aforesaid suit, Smt. Pargasi widow of Mahavir was also impleaded as defendant-3. Petitioners claimed their succession from Pargasi, widow of Mahavir, who was allotted Bungalow No. 4, Beli Road, Allahabad in her share. After death of Sri Sahai (Kurmi), name of Smt. Pargasi was recorded as legal heir and after her death, Prithvi Pal Patel was declared as legal heir. Petitioners&#x27; submitted an application dated 24.04.2000 for freehold of Bungalow No. 85/29 Clive Road, Allahabad, area 5050 square meter in the light of Government Order (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;G.O.&#x27;) dated 01.12.1998.

Petitioners then filed Writ Petition No. 21011 of 2012 seeking a direction to District Magistrate, Allahabad to decide freehold application dated 24.04.2000. This writ petition was disposed of on 01.05.2012 giving direction to District Magistrate to take a decision on petitioner&#x27;s aforesaid application. Ultimately, vide order dated 14.06.2012 (Annexure-14 to the writ petition), District Magistrate rejected application dated 24.04.2000 and representation dated 08.05.2012. Petitioners then filed recall application dated 09.07.2012 seeking recall of exparte order dated 14.06.2012 but nothing has been done thereon, hence, W.P.-1 has been filed challenging aforesaid order dated 14.06.2012.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"12892832\" id=\"span_1\">8.\tImpugned order has been challenged on the ground that it is exparte order; no opportunity was given to petitioners; G.Os. with regard to freehold were not followed; in the Master Plan, land use was shown as &#x27;Commercial&#x27; and to treat disputed land as &#x27;Residential&#x27; is erroneous and decision of Collector is arbitrary, shows non application of mind and unfair. Reliance has been placed on a Division Bench decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/12892832/\" id=\"a_1\">Sangam Upniveshan Avas Evam Nirman Sahkari Samiti Ltd. vs. State of U.P. and Others</a> 2018 (7) ADJ 617 (DB).</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">9.\tA counter affidavit has been filed by respondents sworn by Sri Rajesh Kumar Rai, Additional District Magistrate (Nazul), Allahabad. It is said that Plot No. R-Naseebpur, Bakhtiyara, Allahabad, area 4 acres 3 roods 2 poles (i.e. 19731.96 square metre) is a &#x27;Nazul land&#x27;. Lease deed was executed on 11.10.1902 in favour of Sri Sahai (kurmi) sons of Sheo Din for a period of 30 years, with effect from 01.07.1902. The initial period of lease was subject to renewal twice of 30 years each and a total period, not more than 90 years. Initial tenure of lease expired on 30.06.1932. Thus, taking maximum period of lease it would have expired on 30.06.1992. In Nazul Register, names of Mewa Lal, Raja Ram, grand-sons of Sri Sahai (Kurmi) and sons of Pitamber as well as Smt. Pargasi, daughter-in-law of Pitamber, Jokhu another son of original lessee, i.e., Sri Sahai (Kurmi) and Baijnath, grandson of Sri Sahai (Kurmi) and son of Jokhu were recorded. Later on, half portion of disputed land was shown in the name of U.P. Agricultural Credit Bank (hereinafter referred to as &quot;U.P.A.C. Bank&quot;). The family tree of Sri Sahai Kurmi is as under: \n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">Sahai (Kurmi)\n \n(died in 1915)\n \n /\n \nSamera (Wife)\n \n/\n \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">--------------------------------------------------------\n</blockquote> \n<pre id=\"pre_2\">\t\t\t/\t\t\t\t\t      /\n \n\t\t   Pitamber\t\t\t\t\tJokhu\n \n\t\t           /\t\t\t\t\t                   /\n \n\t\t          /\t\t\t\t\t\tBaijnath\n \n\t--------------------------------------------\n \n\t     /\t\t      /\t\t        /\n \n          Mahabir                Rajaram           Mewalal\n \n\t   /                                          Ganeshia (wife)\n \n      Smt.

Bank. He failed to pay loan whereupon recovery suit was filed by U.P.A.C.Bank and in execution sale, U.P.A.C.Bank itself purchased that part of disputed Nazul land on 04.09.1943. Possession was delivered to U.P.A.C.Bank on 04.05.1946. This is evident from the judgment dated 05.10.1961 of this Court passed in Second Appeal No. 2189 of 1951, U.P. Agricultural Credit Bank Limited versus Baij Nath and 2 Others. After expiry of first term of lease in 1932, no application for renewal of lease was given by anyone. The partition suits, referred to in writ petition, are not concerned with respondents since State of U.P. and its authorities were not party, either in Suit No. 51 of 1916 or 81 of 1974. Moreover, parties to the suit did not own land. The only right, at the best they could have, was lease right, which also expired on 30.6.1932. Hence, there could not have been any division or partition of ownership of land in dispute. Petitioner and other heirs of original lessee committed breach of conditions of lease, inasmuch as, they raised construction of non-residential buildings on disputed land, hence, an order was passed by Collector, Allahabad on 24.09.1992 (Annexure CA-3) directing Mukhya Nagar Adhikari, Nagar Mahapalika, Allahabad to enter the name of State Government in &#x27;Nazul Register&#x27; and take appropriate action for possession of entire land from unauthorized occupants. Order dated 24.09.1992 was challenged by Smt. Ram Dulari wife of Prithvi Pal in Writ Petition No. 36227 of 1992 seeking following reliefs:-\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">&quot;i. \tissue a writ order or direction in the nature of certiorari quashing the impugned notice dated 18.2.1992 as issued by the respondent no. 2 (Annexure-4), the impugned order passed by the respondent no. 2 dated 24.9.1992 (Annexure-6) the news item as published in Nav Bharat Times dated 2.10.1992 (Annexure-7) and the entire proceedings consequent upon the notice dated 18.2.1992 (Annexure-4) in respect to the property situated over Plot No. &#x27;R&#x27; of village Naseebpur, Bakthiara Pargana Chail, District Allahabad, known as 19 Muir Road 23 Clive Road, now numbers 277/87 Muir Road, 85/29 Clive Road.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">ii.\tissue a writ order or direction in the nature of mandamus directing the respondent no. 2 to consider the petitioners application for renewal of lease dated 17.9.1990 (Annexure-2) in accordance with law.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">iii.\tissue any other alternative and suitable writ order or direction as this Hon&#x27;ble Court may deem fit and proper in the circumstances of the case.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">iv. \taward costs of the petitioner throughout to the petitioners.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">11.\tWrit Petition was ultimately dismissed as not pressed, vide Court&#x27;s order dated 22.11.1999. In the aforesaid writ petition, wife, sons and daughters of Prithvi Pal were petitioners and besides State of U.P., District Magistrate, Allahabad and Others, Asharfi Lal and Moti Lal, sons of Mewa Lal, and Raja Ram son of Pitamber were impleaded as respondents. As a result of dismissal of writ petition, order dated 24.09.1992 attained finality in respect of those petitioners and in respect of others also since they did not challenge the said order.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">12.\tLater on, Smt. Suraj Kali claiming herself to be legal heir of Sri Sahai (kurmi), filed Writ Petition No. 31358 of 2009 seeking a direction for deciding her claim for freehold rights of land in dispute and therein present petitioners were impleaded as respondents-5 to 9. Suraj Kali pleaded  that they (respondents 5-9) were not entitled to have any right over disputed plot. Aforesaid writ petition was also dismissed as not pressed. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">13.\tCollector thereafter examined claim of petitioners for freehold and passed a detailed order holding that they were not entitled for freehold, in the facts stated above. Opposing the writ petition, it is said in the counter affidavit that petitioners are not entitled for grant of freehold for following reasons:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">&quot;(a)\tthe concerned lease deed dated 11.10.1902 has already been rescinded/ cancelled by the order dated 24.09.1992, and the name of the State of Uttar Pradesh has been re-entered, and thus, the petitioners could/cannot be treated to have entered into the shoes of the aforementioned &quot;Sri Sahai Kurmi&quot; (original lessee) in any manner whatsoever qua the disputed plot. \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">\tWithout prejudice to the aforesaid, even otherwise, \n \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">(b) \tthe petitioners could/ cannot be treated to be the exclusive owners of the said specific portion of the disputed-plot for which, the application was submitted by the petitioners for the grant of free-hold rights.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">\tAs stated hereinbefore, no reliance could/ can be placed upon the partition decree passed in the aforementioned Suit No. 81 of 1974 on account of the reasons mentioned hereinbefore, and thus, without prejudice, if there has been any right upon the disputed-plot of t he heirs of the said &quot;Sri Sahai Kurmi&quot; then the same has been equally of all the surviving heirs of the said &quot;Sri Sahai Kurmi&quot; since all of them, if entered, then jointly, entered into the shoes of the said &quot;Sri Sahai Kurmi&quot;, and thus, the petitioners should have submitted that consent of all the remaining surviving heirs of &quot;Sri Sahai Kurmi&quot; for the purpose of grant of free-hold rights in favour of the petitioners upon the particular/ specific portion of the disputed plot for which the concerned application for the grant of free hold rights upon the disputed plot was filed by the petitioners; \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\tWithout prejudice to the aforesaid, even otherwise, \n \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">(c) the unauthorized constructions without the permission of the Answering-Respondent No. 2 that too for the commercial purposes, have been raised upon the disputed-plot, and thus, the petitioners have violated the terms of the said lease-deed and as per the report of the Nagar Nigam, Allahabad, the &quot;land use&quot; of the disputed-plot in the Master-Plan during the relevant period was residential and the said violation could not be treated to have been waived by the State Government, particularly at the time of the submissions of the application by the petitioners for the grant of free-hold rights upon the disputed plot;\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">\tWithout prejudice to the aforesaid, even otherwise, \n \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">(d) \tin view of the averments made in the said Writ Petition No. 31358 of 2009, it is evident that all the surviving heirs of the said &quot;Sri Sahai Kurmi&quot; have not come/ reached upon an amicable settlement with regard to the grant of free-hold rights upon the disputed plot, and thus, the petitioners are not entitled for the free hold rights upon the disputed plot in this view of the matter.&quot;\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">14.\tA rejoinder affidavit has been filed stating that on 17.09.1990, application for renewal of lease was submitted. Alleging that lease was not got renewed; unauthorized construction has been made and possession has been given to unauthorized persons, a show-cause notice was given by District Magistrate, Allahabad to petitioners and other legal heirs of original lessee on 18.02.1992. Petitioners submitted reply on 02.03.1992. In the meantime, in respect of Bungalow No. 19, Muir Road, Allahabad, R.S.A.Society claiming its own right over disputed Nazul land, filed Writ Petition No. 26876 of 1993 wherein this Court made an observation that matter may be examined by competent authority and subject to such observation, writ petition was dismissed. The order passed by this Court on 05.02.2009 reads as under:- \n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\t&quot;Having heard Sri Rahul Sripat learned counsel for the petitioner at some length and after going through the record we find that lease deed was executed in the year 1902 for 30 years in favour of original lessee, who transferred the same in favour of the company namely U.P. Agriculture Credit Bank Limited. The company did not get lease renewed after 30 years and continued in possession. The company went in liquidation proceeding and the property in dispute so leased to the original lessee and sold to the company was sold in liquidation proceeding. Since the lease was not renewed in favour of the company, therefore, right of the purchaser from the company i.e. right of the vendor and the right of the petitioner vendee was subject to renewal of the lease. Therefore no writ of mandamus can be issued for renewal of the lease after such a long gap. In our opinion the initial order of Collector, Allahabad was by way of mistake which was corrected by him by withdrawing the said order. Thus the position emerges that the terms of the lease has already expired and the petitioner has no right to claim writ of mandamus from this Court. However, it is open to the petitioner to approach the State Government for grant of fresh lease under the Government Grant Act. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\tConsidering the entire facts of the case and taking into account the fact that the petitioner has paid consideration for purchasing the land from the company in liquidation proceeding and in the liquidation proceeding the Government did not raise any objection that it cannot be sold in liquidation proceeding as lease was not renewed in favour of the company. Therefore the State Government is otherwise stopped from taking such an objection as the doctrine of estoppel will directly come in the way. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\tIn view of the above discussion the matter is relegated to the State government to pass a fresh order on merits after scrutinizing and examining the rival claims of the parties and material available on record. It may also consider the claim of Smt. Ram Dulari and others, who have filed impleadment application in the writ petition. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\tFor the aforesaid reasons this writ petition is dismissed.&quot; \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">(Emphasis added)\n \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">15.\tIn the meantime, it appears that a complaint was made by one Brijesh Patel and others to State Government whereupon State Government sought comments from District Magistrate, Allahabad who sent its report vide letter dated 26.11.2012. It was mentioned therein that Bungalow No. 19, Muir Road, Allahabad/ 21 Clive Road, Allahabad was never given in possession to Umeshwar Nath son of Harihar Nath as no such document was available on record. With regard to litigation between U.P.A.C. Bank and Jokhulal, it is said that petitioners were neither party in Suit No. 913 of 1946 nor in Civil Appeal No. 97 of 1950 nor in Second Appeal No. 2189 of 1991. It is also said that matter is pending for consideration before State Government pursuant to an order passed by this Court in Writ Petition No. 26876 of 1993. (We have already observed that this writ petition was dismissed on 05.02.2009). Predecessor in interest of petitioners constructed Bungalow over land of 21, Clive Road, R-Naseebpur, Bakhtiyara. The order cancelling lease deed was challenged by petitioners in Writ Petition No. 36227 of 1992 wherein an interim order was passed and matter is pending before State Government and petitioners were not entitled for freehold of land in dispute in the light of G.O. dated 28.01.2011 and G.O. dated 04.03.2014 is not applicable to petitioners. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">Writ Petition No. 34702 of 2018 (WP-2)\n \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">16.\tThe case set up by petitioner is that it is a Housing Society registered by U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad under <a href=\"/doc/129412684/\" id=\"a_2\">U.P. Cooperative Societies Act, 1965</a> (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Act, 1965&quot;) vide Registration Certificate issued by Deputy Housing Commissioner/Sub-Registrar, U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad, Lucknow on 11.02.1982 and has been renewed from time to time. Property in dispute was leased out to Sri Sahai son of Sri Sheo Din in 1902, for a period of 90 years, initially for 30 years and renewable for two terms of 30 years each. Partition suit between two sons of Sahai i.e. Pitamber and Jokhu resulted in property in dispute going to share of Jokhu. He got loan from U.P.A.C. Bank creating an equitable mortgage of Bungalow No. 19, Muir Road, Allahabad. Jokhu committed default in payment of dues. U.P.A.C. Bank filed Original Suit No. 173 of 1940 under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_3\">Order XXXIV CPC</a> for sale of Bungalow. Suit was decreed in favour of U.P.A.C.Bank vide decree dated 01.05.1946 and pursuant thereto, Bungalow was auctioned which was purchased by U.P.A.C.Bank itself and possession was taken by Bank on 01.05.1946. In the meantime, Baij Nath son of Jokhu filed suit for setting aside decree on the ground that mortgage was without legal necessity. Suit was dismissed whereagainst appeal was also dismissed by this Court. Thereafter, sale was confirmed and sale certificate dated 09.04.1946 was issued giving possession of Bungalow on 04.05.1946 to auction purchaser. Bank filed another Suit No. 913 of 1946 for recovery of certain dues from Baij Nath, which was decreed but Bank lost in Civil Appeal No. 97 of 1950 and then matter came to this Court in Second Appeal No. 2189 of 1951. This Court allowed appeal vide judgement dated 05.10.1961 and a decree of Rs. 3,100/- was passed with six per cent future interest against Baij Nath and Others. Name of U.P.A.C.Bank was entered in Nazul Register on half of the disputed Nazul land. The total area was 23600 square yards out of which 11800 square yards at Bungalow No. 19, Muir Road, Allahabad and remaining 11800 square yards at Bungalow No. 23, Clive Road, Allahabad. U.P.A.C.Bank underwent liquidation proceedings whereupon one Sridhar, Advocate was appointed as Liquidator vide Court&#x27;s order dated 11.09.1958. U.P.A.C.Bank had two Directors namely, Harihar Nath and his wife Malti Devi who resolved in the meeting that assets of U.P.A.C.Bank may be disposed of by transferring Bungalow No. 19, Muir Road, Allahabad to Sri Umeshwar Nath son of Harihar Nath. Information of said transfer was given to official Liquidator. U.P.A.C.Bank was ultimately dissolved on 23.05.1960. Umeshwar Nath son of Harihar Nath executed sale-deed of disputed property i.e. Bungalow No. 19, Muir Road, Allahabad on 06.02.1989 in favour of petitioner and intimation was also given to Collector, Allahabad vide letter dated 07.04.1989. Lease deed of 1902 was an intimated lease. Additional District Magistrate, Allahabad approved renewal of lease in favour of petitioner and communicated to Mukhya Nagar Adhikari, Nagar Mahapalika, Allahabad vide letter dated 24.07.1993 directing it to prepare requisite document for registration of lease deed. A similar direction was also given vide letter dated 31.07.1993. Vide letter dated 04.08.1993, In-charge Adhikari (Nazul) required petitioner to deposit lease rent. Since lease deed was not executed, petitioner approached this Court in Writ Petition No. 26876 of 1993. Thereafter, respondent-2 withdrew earlier order vide order dated 09.09.1993. The order dated 09.09.1993 was also challenged in above writ petition by way of amendment. Subject to certain observations, the writ petition was ultimately dismissed vide judgement dated 05.02.2009.

Naseebpur Bakhtiyara (Nazul Land) was executed in favour of Sri Sahai son of Shiv Din (Kurmi) by Secretary of State for India in Council. Area of land was 4 acres 3 roods 21 poles. Initially, lease was granted for 30 years subject to renewal of 30 years each and maximum 90 years. Sri Sahai (Kurmi) died in 1915 leaving behind his widow Smt. Sumera and two sons namely Pitamber and Jokhu. Partition suit filed by Pitamber i.e. Suit No.51 of 1916 was decreed allotting a share of 5 anna 4 pai to Sumera and same share was allotted to Pitamber and Jokhu. Jokhu had only one son Baijnath. Baijnath, after the death of Jokhu, executed sale deed transferring his share to Smt. Pargasi wife of Mahavir Prasad (Kurmi). She constructed Bungalow no.19, Muir Road, Allahabad on the land purchased by her. Pitamber had three sons namely Mahavir, Rajaram and Mewalal. On 06.01.1930, Mewalal and Rajaram transferred their share in favour of Subratan, resident of Shahganj, Allahabad, who further transferred his said share to Pargasi and Prithvipal vide registered sale deed dated 20.09.1938.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">22.\tOn the basis of information received under <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_10\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a> (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Act, 2005&quot;) from the office of Land Record, petitioners found that Smt. Sumera widow of Sri Sahai (Kurmi) executed a Will on 14.02.1924 and transferred her entire share in favour of her grandson Prithvipal son of Mahavir in respect of Bungalow No.21, Clive Road, R Naseebpur Bakhtiyara and Bungalow No.06, Vake Nepiar Line, Muskat Road, New Cantt., Allahabad. Baijnath, in the year 1938, took loan from U.P.A.C. Bank by mortgaging disputed property though he had no right over it having transferred the same in favour of Pargasi in 1932. Moreover, for transfer of said land, prior permission of Collector was mandatory.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">23.\tBaijnath committed default in payment of his loan amount, which resulted in recovery suit by U.P.A.C. Bank and the same was ultimately finalized upto this Court in Second Appeal No.2189 of 1951 but therein petitioners or Pargasi or Prithvipal were not party. Defendant-respondents in aforesaid appeal were Baij Nath son of Jokhu Lal, Smt. Minda widow of Jokhu Lal and Smt. Sursati widow of Jagmal. U.P.A.C. Bank itself went into liquidation and one Umeshwar Nath son of Harihar Nath claiming to be Director of U.P.A.C. Bank treated property in dispute as his own property though it was never owned by him. R.S.A. Society, petitioner in WP-2 claims its ownership on the basis of sale deed dated 11.03.1989 executed by Umeshwar Nath though Umeshwar Nath had neither any right over property in dispute nor could have transferred any interest or right over the same to R.S.A.Society. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">24.\tR.S.A. Society, on the basis of sale deed dated 11.03.1989 got lease renewed in its favour in 1993 but when petitioners of WP-3 objected, the said order was recalled by Collector, Allahabad. This recall order of Collector was challenged by R.S.A. Society in Writ Petition No.26876 of 1993. The writ petition was dismissed vide judgment dated 05.02.2009 with observation that State Government shall look into the matter and pass fresh order. The judgment dated 05.02.2009 passed by this Court dismissing Writ Petition No.26876 of 1993 reads as under :\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">\t&quot;Having heard Sri Rahul Sripat learned counsel for the petitioner at some length and after going through the record we find that sale deed was executed in the year 1902 for 30 years in favour of original lessee, who transferred the same in favour of the company namely U.P.Agriculture Credit Bank Limited. The company did not get lease renewed after 30 years and continued in possession. The company went in liquidation proceeding and the property in dispute so leased to the original lessee and sold to the company was sold in liquidation proceeding. Since the lease was not renewed in favour of the company, therefore, right of the purchaser from the company i.e. right of the vendor and the right of the petitioner vendee was subject to renewal of the lease. Therefore no writ of mandamus can be issued for renewal of the lease after such a long gap. In our opinion the initial order of Collector, Allahabad was by way of mistake which was corrected by him by withdrawing the said order. Thus the position emerges that the terms of the lease has already expired and the petitioner has no right to claim writ of mandamus from this Court. However, it is open to the petitioner to approach the State Government for grant of fresh lease under the Government Grant Act.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">\tConsidering the entire facts of the case and taking into account the fact that the petitioner has paid consideration for purchasing the land from the company in liquidation proceeding and in the liquidation proceeding the Government did not raise any objection that it cannot be sold in liquidation proceeding as lease was not renewed in favour of the company. Therefore the State Government is otherwise stopped from taking such an objection as the doctrine of estoppel will directly come in the way.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">\tIn view of the above discussion the matter is relegated to the State government to pass a fresh order on merits after scrutinizing and examining the rival claims of the parties and material available on record. It may also consider the claim of Smt. Ram Dulari and others, who have filed impleadment application in the writ petition.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">\tFor the aforesaid reasons this writ petition is dismissed.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">(Emphasis added)\n \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_38\">25.\tThe claim of R.S.A.

In the meantime, petitioners applied for freehold vide applications dated 24.04.2000 and 01.05.2012.

Property may also be acquired and owned by State by way of acquisition under the Statute relating to acquisition of land or by purchase through negotiation or gift by an individual or in similar other manners. All such land, which is owned and vested in State Government results in making the State, owner of such land, but in legal parlance, the term &quot;Nazul&quot; is not applicable to all such land. It is only such land which is owned and vested in State on account of its capacity of Sovereign, and application of right of bona vacantia, which is covered by the term &#x27;Nazul&#x27;, as the term is known for the last more than one and half century. In Legal Glossary 1992, fifth edition, published by Legal Department of Government of India, at page 589, meaning of the term &#x27;Nazul&#x27; has been given as &#x27;Rajbhoomi, i.e., Government land&#x27;.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">36.\tNazul is an Arabic word. It refers to a land annexed to Crown. During British Regime, immoveable property of individuals, Zamindars, Nawabs and Rajas when confiscated for one or the other reason, it was termed as &#x27;Nazul property&#x27;. The reason being that neither it was acquired nor purchased after making payment. In old record, when such land was referred in Urdu, this kind of land was shown as &#x27;Jaidad Munzabta&#x27;.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">37.\tFor dealing with such property, under the authority of Lt. Governor of North Western Provinces, two orders were issued in October, 1846 and October, 1848. Therein, after the words &quot;Nazul property&quot;, its english meaning was given as &#x27;Escheats to the Government&#x27;. Sadar Board of Revenue on May 20, 1845 issued a circular order in reference to &quot;Nazul land&quot; and in para 2 thereof it mentioned, &quot;The Government is the proprietor of those land and no valid title to them can be derived but from the Government&quot;. Nazul land was also termed as &quot;Confiscated Estate&quot;. Under Circular dated July 13, 1859, issued by Government of North Western Provinces, every Commissioner was obliged to keep a final confiscation statement of each District and lay it before Government for orders. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">38.\tRight of King to take property by &#x27;escheat&#x27; or as &#x27;bona vacantia&#x27; was recognized by common law of England. Escheat of property was Lord&#x27;s right of re-entry on real property held by a tenant, dying intestate, without lawful heirs. It was an incident of Feudal Tenure and based on the want of a tenant to perform Feudal services. On the tenant dying intestate without leaving any lawful heirs, his estate came to an end and Lord, by his own right and not by way of succession or inheritance from the tenant, re-entered real property as owner. In most cases, land escheated to Crown as the &#x27;Lord Paramount&#x27;, in view of gradual elimination of Intermediate or Mesne lords since 1290 AD. Crown takes as &#x27;bona vacantia&#x27; goods in which no one else can claim property. In Dyke v. Walford 5 Moore PC 434= 496-13 ER 557 (580) it was said &#x27;it is the right of the Crown to bona vacantia to property which has no other Owner&#x27;. Right of the Crown to take as &quot;bona vacantia&quot; extends to personal property of every kind. The escheat of real property of an intestate dying without heirs was abolished in 1925 and Crown thereafter could not take such property as bona vacantia. The principle of acquisition of property by escheat, i.e., right of Government to take on property by &#x27;escheat&#x27; or &#x27;bona vacantia&#x27; for want of a rightful owner was enforced in Indian territory during the period of East India Company by virtue of Statute 16 and 17 Victoria, C. 95, section 27.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">39.\tWe may recollect, having gone through history, that prior to 1857, several Estates were taken over by British Company i.e. East India Company by way of annexation.

The above power continued to apply after enactment of Constitution with the only modification that if such land is situate within the territory of State Government, it will vest in State and in other cases, it will vest in Union of India. Vesting of land and giving ownership to State Government or Union of India under <a href=\"/doc/290059/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 296</a> is clearly in respect of a land, which will come to it by way of &#x27;escheat&#x27;, &#x27;lapse&#x27; or &#x27;bona vacantia&#x27; and not by way of acquisition of land under some Statute or purchase etc.\n \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">42.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1783454\" id=\"span_13\">In <a href=\"/doc/1783454/\" id=\"a_26\">Pierce Leslie and Co.

The land owned by State may come to it in various ways, like confiscation, purchase, escheat or bona vacantia, gift, etc. In such a case the ownership vests in State, like any other individual and State is free to deal with the same in a manner like any other owner may do so.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">17.\tThus &#x27;Nazul&#x27; is a land vested in State for any reason whatsoever that is cession or escheat or bona vacantia, for want of rightful owner or for any other reasons and once land belong to State, it will be difficult to assume that State would acquire its own land. It is per se impermissible to acquire such land by forcible acquisition under Act, 1894, since there is no question of any transfer of ownership from one person to another but here State already own it, hence there is no question of any acquisition.&quot;                                                         (Emphasis added)\n \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">54.\tThus the land in question which is admittedly &#x27;Nazul&#x27;, belonged to the category as discussed above i.e. it came to be vested and owned by State in its capacity of Sovereign and right of bona vacantia. When acquisition is made under the provisions of a Statute, purpose of acquisition is already known and State pay its price but when land is owned by State, which is Nazul, objective of use of such land is not predetermined but it can be utilized by State for larger public welfare and its benefit, as necessitated from time to time. In other words &#x27;Nazul&#x27; land forms the assets owned by State in trust for the people in general who are entitled for its user in the most fair and beneficial manner for their benefit. State cannot be allowed to distribute such largesse by pick and choose manner or to some selected groups etc. The first question is answered accordingly.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_103\">55.\tThe second question is &quot;lease in question whether governed by provision of <a href=\"/doc/515323/\" id=\"a_38\">Transfer of Property Act, 1882</a> (hereinafter referred to as &quot;<a href=\"/doc/515323/\" id=\"a_39\">TP Act, 1882</a>&quot;) or <a href=\"/doc/1625086/\" id=\"a_40\">GG Act, 1895</a> and what is inter-relationship of the two?&quot;\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">56.\tHistorical documents, record as also authorities discussed above show that earlier Government i.e. East India Company upto 1858 and thereafter British Government used to allot &quot;Nazul land&quot; to various persons, who had shown their alliance to such Government in various ways, sometimes by deceiving their Indian counter parts who had raised voice against British Rule, or those who remained faithful to Foreign regime and helped them for their continuation in ruling this country and similar other reasons. Sometimes land was given on lease without any condition and sometimes restricted for certain period etc., but in every case, lease was given to those persons who were faithful and shown complete alliance to British Rule. The reason was that in respect of Nazul, no predetermined objective was available as was the case in respect of land acquired by State by way of acquisition under Statute of Acquisition after paying compensation or purchase. Further, allocation of Nazul land by English Rulers used to be called &quot;Grant&quot;. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_105\">57.\tIn other words, we can say that initially land owned by State used to be allotted in the form of &#x27;Grant&#x27; by British Government. No specific statutory provisions were available to govern it. <a href=\"/doc/515323/\" id=\"a_41\">TP Act, 1882</a> was enacted to govern transfer of immovable property. <a href=\"/doc/576368/\" id=\"a_42\">Sections 10</a> - 12 of <a href=\"/doc/515323/\" id=\"a_43\">TP Act, 1882</a> made provisions invalidating, with certain exceptions, all conditions for forfeiture of transferred property on alienation by transferee and all limitations over consequence upon such alienation or any insolvency of or attempted alienation by him.

Therein dispute related to Plot No. 59, Civil Station, Allahabad, area 1 acre and 4272 sq. yard, i.e., 9112 sq. yard or 7618 sq. meter. Initially a lease deed was executed on 11.01.1868 by Secretary of State for India in Council, in favour of one, Thomas Crowby, for a period of 50 years and it was signed by Commissioner, Allahabad Division on behalf of Secretary of State for India in Council. After expiry of lease, a fresh lease was executed for another period of 50 years on 12.04.1923 w.e.f. 01.01.1918. Lease holder with permission of Collector, Allahabad transferred lease rights to Purshottam Das in 1945. The legal heirs of Sri Purshottam Das, on 31.10.1958, transferred leasehold rights in favour of Smt. Shakira Khatoon Kazmi, Smt. Sabira Khatoon Kazmi and Smt. Maimoona Khatoon Kazmi. After the death of Smt. Maimoona Khatoon Kazmi, her legal heirs, namely, Azim Ahmad Kazmi, Omar Ahmad Kazmi, Shamim Ahmad Kazmi, Alim Ahmad Kazmi and Maaz Ahmad Kazmi also claimed lease rights by succession. Lease granted on 12.04.1923 w.e.f. 01.01.1918 expired on 31.12.1967. It was renewed on 19.03.1996 for a period of 30 years w.e.f. 01.01.1968 which period expired on 31.12.1997. Again on 17.07.1998 it was renewed for a further period of 30 years w.e.f. 01.01.1998. While lease was continuing, vide Government Order dated 15.12.2000, right of resumption was exercised by State Government. It directed resumption of possession of plot in question and lease deed was cancelled. District Magistrate, Allahabad served a notice dated 11.01.2001 to lease holders intimating them that State Government&#x27;s order dated 15.12.2000 has cancelled lease and resumed possession of land in question, as the same was required for public purpose. Notice also directed lease holders to remove structures standing on plot, failing which possession would be taken in accordance with Clause 3(c) of lease deed. Lease holders filed objections against notice to District Magistrate and also stated that they have sent representation/ objection to Chief Minister praying for revocation of Government Order dated 15.12.2000. District Magistrate passed order on 24.08.2001 rejecting objection of lease holders and sent a cheque of Rs. 10 lacs representing compensation for the building standing over plot. State authorities claimed that they took possession of open land on 01.09.2001.</span> Lease holders filed writ petition which was dismissed vide judgment dated 07.12.2001, Shakira Khatoon Kazmi vs. State of U.P., AIR 2002 All 101. Lease holders challenged judgment dated 07.12.2001 in Supreme Court to the extent they failed. State Government filed appeal against part of order of this Court wherein an observation was made that State Government is not entitled to take forcible possession though it may take possession of demised premises in accordance with procedure established by law. After considering Clause 3(c) of lease deed which provides for resumption of land for public purpose after giving a month&#x27;s clear notice to lessee to remove any building standing at the time on demised premises and within two months of receipt of notice, to take possession thereof on expiry of that period, and <a href=\"/doc/907595/\" id=\"a_117\">Sections 2</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211108/\" id=\"a_118\">3</a> of GG Act, 1895, Court said that Clause 3(c) of lease deed confers power upon State Government that plot in question, if required by Government for its own purpose or for any public purpose, it shall have the right to give one month&#x27;s notice in writing to lessees to remove any building standing on the plot and to take possession thereof on expiry of two months from the date of service of notice. Court said that land, if required for any public purpose, State Government has absolute power to resume leased property. Under the terms of Grant, it is absolute, therefore, order of resumption is perfectly valid and cannot be said to be illegal. It also refers to an earlier instance where Nazul Plot No. 13, Civil Station, Allahabad situate in Civil Lines area was resumed by State Government for the purpose of construction of a &#x27;Bus Stand&#x27; by exercising similar power, without initiating any proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/7832/\" id=\"a_119\">Land Acquisition Act, 1894</a> (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Act, 1894&quot;). Resumption in that case was challenged in Writ Petition No. 44517 of 1998, Sayed Shah Khursheed Ahmad Kashmi vs. State of U.P. and said writ petition was dismissed on 16.12.1999 by a Division Bench of this Court, whereagainst Special Leave Petition No. 4329 of 2000 was dismissed by Supreme Court on 07.09.2001.

When a land is acquired under <a href=\"/doc/7832/\" id=\"a_120\">LA Act, 1894</a>, Government can take possession in accordance with provisions of said Act and in case of urgency, Collector can take possession after publication of notice under Section 9 and no separate procedure is required to be followed. Court said that similarly where a lease has been granted under the terms of <a href=\"/doc/1625086/\" id=\"a_121\">GG Act, 1895</a>, then what procedure has to be followed is provided by <a href=\"/doc/211108/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 3</a> of GG Act, 1895 which says that all provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations contained in any such creation, conferment or Grant referred to in <a href=\"/doc/907595/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 2</a>, shall be valid and take effect according to their tenor; any decree or direction of a Court of Law or any rule of law, statute or enactments of the Legislature, to the contrary notwithstanding. Court relied on its earlier judgment in <a href=\"/doc/79815/\" id=\"a_124\">State of U.P. vs. Zahoor Ahmad</a>, 1973(2) SCC 547 holding that <a href=\"/doc/211108/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 3</a> of GG Act, 1895 declares unfettered discretion of Government to impose such conditions and limitation as it thinks fit, no matter what the general law of land be. Then Court construing Clause 3(C) of lease deed said that it provides procedure for taking possession of demised premises when State Government re-enter or resume possession of demised land. Court in para 30 and 32 of judgment said:</span> \n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">&quot;30. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"79815\" id=\"span_34\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/79815/\" id=\"a_126\">The State of U.P. vs. Zahoor Ahmad and Another</a>, 1973(2) SCC 547, this Court held that the <a href=\"/doc/211108/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 3</a> of the Act declares the unfettered discretion of the Government to impose such conditions and limitation as it thinks fit, no matter what the general law of land be. From Clause 3(C) of the deed, it is clear that the State of U.P. while granting lease made it clear that if the demised premises are at any time required by the lessor for his or for any public purpose, he shall have the right to give one month&#x27;s clear notice to the lessee to remove any building standing at the time of the demised property and within two months&#x27; of the receipt of the notice to take possession thereof on the expiry of that period subject to the condition that the lessor is willing to purchase the property on the demised premises, the lessee shall be paid for such amount as may be determined by the Secretary to the Government of U.P. in the Nagar Awas Department.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">&quot;32.

Further, &#x27;Grant&#x27; means transfer of property by a deed in writing and includes within its ambit, an instrument of lease/lease deed. Such &#x27;Grant&#x27; is governed by provision of <a href=\"/doc/1625086/\" id=\"a_128\">GG Act, 1895</a>, which were applicable to &#x27;Grants&#x27; executed on and after enforcement of <a href=\"/doc/1625086/\" id=\"a_129\">GG Act, 1895</a> and rights and entitlement of private parties in respect of land, which was transferred to such person under such &#x27;Grant&#x27; would be governed by terms and conditions contained in such &#x27;Grant&#x27; and not by provisions of <a href=\"/doc/515323/\" id=\"a_130\">TP Act, 1882</a> or any other Statute. The terms and conditions of &#x27;Grant&#x27; shall override any Statute providing otherwise. Moreover, in State of U.P., wherever applicable, U.P. Tenancy Act, 1939 and Agra Tenancy Act, 1926 will also be inapplicable to such &#x27;Grant&#x27;.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_135\">83.\tAbove discussion, therefore, leaves no manner of doubt that Grant/Lease of Nazul land shall be exclusively governed by stipulations/conditions/terms contained in Grant/Indenture of Lease and no Statute can be resorted to govern rights of parties over Nazul land, which will be governed by aforesaid Grant/Indenture of Lease. We, therefore, answer second question accordingly.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_136\">84.\tThe third and fourth questions are, &quot;Whether petitioners have any actionable claim, right or interest over disputed land after expiry of lease on 30.06.1932, and order of re-entry passed by Collector on 24.9.1992 has attained finality?&quot; and &quot;whether petitioners are entitled to a quit notice?&quot;\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_137\">85.\tWe have reproduced contents of lease deed constituting terms and conditions to govern the land in dispute. In almost every aspect, some restrictions on exercise of lease rights over Nazul land were imposed by Grantor/Lessor i.e. State. Some such instances are :\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">(i)\tIf there is any breach in payment of rent or other covenant of lease deed in such case it shall be lawful for Secretary of State to enter into and upon the said demised premises and dwelling house and out buildings erected as aforesaid or any part thereof in the name of whole and thereupon the same shall remain to the use of and be vested in Secretary of State as if the deed was not executed.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">(ii)\tRenewal of lease shall be at the request and cost of lessee.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">(iii)\tTotal period of lease including renewal shall not exceed 90 years.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">(iv)\tNo construction other than dwelling house shall be made without permission for trade or business.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_138\">86.\tEntire lease deed show that if premises is assigned, within one calendar month, a notice was to be given to Collector giving details of persons but in case of any non observance or breach, it was lawful for Lessor to enter upon demised premises.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">87.\tAs already said that after 30th June, 1932 i.e. expiry of first term of lease, there was no renewal of term of lease at all. Land was shared by heirs of Sri Sahai as if it was owned by him or them though Sri Sahai had only lease rights. After expiry of lease on 30.06.1932, even lease rights ceased.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_140\">88.\tIt is nobody&#x27;s case that any rent or premium was paid thereafter to the State. With regard to intimation also, there is nothing on record to show as to that when part of land was equitably mortgaged to U.P.A.C. Bank or the manner in which it was subsequently dealt with by Bank or anything was communicated to Lessor. It is in these circumstances, Collector rightly rejected application for renewal of lease vide order dated 24.09.1992 whereby Mukhya Nagar Adhikari was directed to record name of State in Nazul register. The said order has attained finality.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_141\">89.\tIn fact, the initial lease commenced on 01.07.1902, the period of 90 years lapsed on 30.6.1992. If renewal would have been allowed, even then no lease to lessees could have been granted for period subsequent to 30.6.1992 since maximum period of lease including two renewals was 90 years.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_142\">90.\tThus, petitioners had no legal right whatsoever over property in dispute in any manner after 30.6.1932 and, in any case, after 30.6.1992.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_143\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"106781280\" id=\"span_35\">91.\tSo far as claim of petitioners that they have submitted application for freehold, it has already been held by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/106781280/\" id=\"a_131\">Anand Kumar Sharma vs. State of U.P. and others</a> 2014(2) ADJ 742 (FB) that mere submission of application does not give any vested right for freehold. State is the owner of property and it has already rejected application for renewal in 1992 and has re-entered the premises directing for recording name of the State in Nazul register over land in dispute. Land being Nazul, State Government is fully empowered to re-enter/resume at any point of time.</span> \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43722908\" id=\"span_36\">92.\tMoreso, when it is required in public purpose, such right of State in respect of Nazul land has been recognized in <a href=\"/doc/43722908/\" id=\"a_132\">Azim Ahmad Kazmi and Others Vs. State of U.P. and Others</a> (supra). Mere continuation in possession over land in dispute does not give any right to petitioners. Neither <a href=\"/doc/349627/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 116</a> of TP Act, 1882 gets attracted nor petitioners are entitled to a quit notice. The nature of possession of even a lessee after expiry of period of lease is that of &#x27;Tenant at Sufference&#x27;. Here petitioner of WP-1 does not come even in that category.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158667548\" id=\"span_37\">93.\tFurther, once lease period expired, whether a quit notice is necessary or not, in our view, is an issue, which need not detain us since this aspect is already covered by a recent authority in <a href=\"/doc/158667548/\" id=\"a_134\">Sevoke Properties Ltd. vs. West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd.</a> AIR 2019 SC 2664. Therein, Court held that once it is admitted by Lessee that term of lease has expired, lease stood determined by efflux of time. Then Court said :</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">&quot;Once the lease stood determined by efflux of time, there was no necessity for a notice of termination Under Section 106.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_146\">(Emphasis added)\n \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_147\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"518480\" id=\"span_38\">94.\tFor taking above view, Court relied on its earlier decision in <a href=\"/doc/518480/\" id=\"a_135\">R.V. Bhupal Prasad v. State of A.P.</a> (1995) 5 SCC 698.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_148\">95.\tIn the above authority, Court held that after expiry of period of lease, status of Lessee becomes that of &#x27;Tenant at sufferance&#x27;.  &#x27;Tenant at sufference&#x27; is one who comes into possession of land by lawful title, but who holds it by wrong after termination of term or expiry of lease by efflux of time. The tenant at sufferance is one who wrongfully continues in possession after extinction of a lawful title. There is little difference between him and a trespasser. Quoting from Mulla&#x27;s Transfer of Property Act (7th Edn.) at page 633, Court observed that tenancy at sufferance is merely a fiction to avoid continuance in possession operating as a trespass. It has been described as the least and lowest interest which can subsist in reality. It, therefore, cannot be created by contract and arises only by implication of law when a person who has been in possession under a lawful title continues in possession after that title has been determined, without consent of person entitled. A &quot;tenancy at sufferance&quot; does not create relationship of landlord and tenant. Court further quoted from page 769 of Mulla&#x27;s transfer of <a href=\"/doc/3482533/\" id=\"a_136\">Property Act</a> (7th Edition), that act of holding over after expiration of term does not necessarily create a tenancy of any kind. If lessee remains in possession after determination of term, the common law Rule is that he is a tenant at sufferance. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">96.\tIn the present case, it is not the case of any of the petitioner that after expiry of lease on 30.06.1992, they have been permitted to remain in possession of disputed Nazul land and rent has been accepted by respondents or they have paid rent. Even if what is said by petitioners is taken to be correct, we do not find that Section 116 is applicable in the case in hand at all. <a href=\"/doc/349627/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 116</a> of TP Act, 1882 reads as under :\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">&quot;116. Effect of holding over.- If a lessee or under-lessee of property remains in possession thereof after the determination of the lease granted to the lessee, and the lessor or his legal representative accepts rent from the lessee or under lessee, or otherwise assents to his continuing in possession, the lease is, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, renewed from year to year, or from month to month, according to the purpose for which the property is leased, as specified in section 106.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_150\">97.\tTwin conditions to attract principle of holding over vide <a href=\"/doc/349627/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 116</a> of TP Act, 1882, which need be satisfied, are:\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">(i) \tAfter determination of lease, lessor or his representative has accepted rent from lessee or under lessee or assent to his continuing in possession; and\n \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">(ii)\tLessee or under-lessee has remained in possession.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\">98.\tNone of the above conditions are attracted/satisfied in this case. Hence <a href=\"/doc/349627/\" id=\"a_139\">Section 116</a>, TP Act, 1882 is not attracted. We, therefore, answer third and fourth questions accordingly.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_152\">99.\tThe fifth and last question is &quot;whether re-entry/resumption of land by Lessor i.e. State  Government is valid?&quot;\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_153\">100.\tSo far as validity of resumption of land for &#x27;public purpose&#x27; is concerned, it could not be disputed that land has been sought to be required by State for &#x27;public purpose&#x27;. Allahabad City has been selected for development as a Smart City and respondents have pleaded that demand of huge land has been made by various Government departments since various Offices, Workshops, Parks, Parking places etc. have to be constructed. The land in dispute has been found suitable for &quot;construction of affordable houses for Weaker Section under &#x27;Pradhan Mantri Avas Yojana (Urban)&#x27;&quot; which are public purpose. In fact, on this aspect, no substantial argument has been made and in our view, resumption of land by State is for &#x27;public purpose&#x27;.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_154\">101.\tIn the result, all the writ petitions lack merit. Dismissed. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_155\">102.\tHowever, considering the facts and circumstances and also the fact that petitioners already enjoyed interim order passed by this Court and continued in possession over land in dispute for the last almost more than a year, we direct petitioners to vacate disputed land within one month from the date of delivery of judgment.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_156\">Order Date :- 31.10.2019\n \nAK/KA\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n    \n      \n  \n </p>","numcites":38,"numcitedby":7,"docsource":"Allahabad High Court","citetid":191069374,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"government grant act","formInput":"government%20grant%20act"},{"value":"partition suit","formInput":"partition%20suit"},{"value":"bona vacantia","formInput":"bona%20vacantia"},{"value":"expiry of lease ","formInput":"expiry%20of%20lease%20"},{"value":"the government grant act,1895","formInput":"the%20government%20grant%20act%2C1895"},{"value":"nazul land","formInput":"nazul%20land"},{"value":"transfer of property act","formInput":"transfer%20of%20property%20act"},{"value":" writ of mandamus","formInput":"%20writ%20of%20mandamus"},{"value":"nazul land lease","formInput":"nazul%20land%20lease"},{"value":"escheat","formInput":"escheat"},{"value":"lease nazul ","formInput":"lease%20nazul%20"},{"value":"lease renewal","formInput":"lease%20renewal"},{"value":"rule of law","formInput":"rule%20of%20law"},{"value":"\"government grants act\"","formInput":"%22government%20grants%20act%22"},{"value":"Transfer of property act and government grants","formInput":"Transfer%20of%20property%20act%20and%20government%20grants"},{"value":"sovereignty","formInput":"sovereignty"},{"value":"land dispute","formInput":"land%20dispute"},{"value":"tp act","formInput":"tp%20act"},{"value":"transfer of property","formInput":"transfer%20of%20property"},{"value":"Attained finality","formInput":"Attained%20finality"}],"cats":[{"value":"transfer-of-property","formInput":"tag:transfer-of-property"},{"value":"saving-of-certain-enactments","formInput":"tag:saving-of-certain-enactments"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
