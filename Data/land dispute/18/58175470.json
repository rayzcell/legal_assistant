Hanuman Din never remained in\n\npossession of any part of the lands nor he had any right or\n\nentitlement over the suit lands; but the grandfather of the\n\nappellants-Gaya Din got a lease in disputed lands of the\n\nrespondents which according to the respondents is a forged\n\ndocument.

The matter was sent to the Revenue Inspector for\n\nenquiry who submitted his report in favour of respondents in\n\nrespect of the ownership of the lands in dispute and the Collector\n\nregistered the report after approving it. In proceedings before the\n\nSub-Divisional Magistrate in Miscellaneous Case No.351/142/69\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1405190/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 145</a> Cr.P.C. initiated by Hanuman Din, the\n\nSub-Divisional Magistrate found Hanuman Din in possession of\n\nlands in khasra Nos.162 and 163 and respondents were found in\n\npossession of land in khasra No.164. Respondents-plaintiffs\n\nalleged that pursuant to the order of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate,\n\nHanuman Din forcibly took possession of land in khasra No.41 and\n\ntherefore, the respondents filed suit for declaration and permanent\n\ninjunction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.    Hanuman    Din   resisted   the   suit   contending   that   the\n\nrespondents have never remained in ownership or possession of\n\nthe disputed lands and the lands belonged to one Ram Raj Singh\n\nbut he was not cultivating the lands and gave it to the\n\npredecessors of the respondents for cultivation on the basis of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                   3</span>\n\fBatai-crop sharing and only because of this, patta was granted at\n\nthe time of settlement in their names. The appellants further\n\naverred that the father of the respondents abandoned the lands\n\nand since revenue tax was not being paid, the khata of the\n\ndisputed lands was cancelled. Case of the appellants-defendants\n\nis that in the auction held by Pawaidar for lease of suit lands and\n\nother lands, bid of Gaya Din was accepted and in this regard, a\n\nlease was issued in his name in Samvat 1986 (1929 A.D.). The\n\nappellants had been in continuous possession of the suit\n\nproperties and the same is reflected in the khataunis and other\n\nrevenue records.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">5.   The trial court vide judgment dated 02.07.1985 dismissed the\n\nrespondents’ suit by holding that Gaya Din has been holding patta-\n\nlease (Ex.D-20) in respect of the suit lands and has been in\n\ncontinuous possession of the disputed lands since 1950 and\n\nthereafter, Hanuman Din was in possession of the same. After\n\nreferring to the orders of the Commissioner (Ex.D-1), the trial court\n\nheld that the Commissioner recorded a finding of fact that the\n\nrespondents got the entries made in the revenue records in their\n\nnames in connivance with the Patwari. The trial court held that the\n\nlease-patta (Ex.D-20) was issued by the then iIlaqedar to Gaya Din\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                  4</span>\n\fand that the said document being more than thirty years old is a\n\ngenuine one. After referring to various khasras and the entries\n\nthereon in the name of appellant’s father, it was held that the\n\nappellants’ father Hanuman Din has been in possession of the suit\n\nlands since 1950 or prior to that. The trial court further held that the\n\nsuit was instituted on 17.10.1975 which is beyond twelve years and\n\nthat the suit is barred by time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">6.    In appeal, the first Appellate Court vide its judgment dated\n\n03.04.1989 held that at the time of settlement, patta was granted in\n\nthe name of father of the respondents and this has not been\n\ndisputed by the appellants and the appellants could not establish\n\nabandonment of the lands by the father of the respondents and\n\ntherefore, the respondents ought to be treated as owners of the\n\nsuit properties. The first Appellate Court further held that the lease\n\nEx.D-20 produced by the appellants cannot be held to be a valid\n\none and in absence of order of revocation of the patta granted to\n\nthe respondents, it cannot be held that Ex.D-20 confers right of\n\nownership on the appellants over the disputed lands. The first\n\nAppellate Court held that merely because of production of patta-\n\nlease – Ex.D-20 by Hanuman Din, it cannot be said to have been\n\nproved and therefore, it cannot be held that Hanuman Din has a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                     5</span>\n\flegal right of ownership on the disputed lands. The first Appellate\n\nCourt noted that on the basis of Ex.D-1 – order of the\n\nCommissioner, possession of the suit properties by the appellants\n\ncannot be held to be proved, since the respondents or their\n\nancestors were not parties to the said proceedings. On these\n\nfindings, the first Appellate Court set aside the judgment of the trial\n\ncourt and held that the respondents are the owners of the disputed\n\nlands and held that the respondents are entitled to get possession\n\nof the lands in khasra Nos. 41, 131, 162 and 163 from the father of\n\nthe appellants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">7.   In the second appeal, the High Court affirmed the findings of\n\nthe first Appellate Court and held that the suit lands were recorded\n\nin the name of fathers of the respondents and that there was no\n\ndocument on record to show that they have abandoned the\n\npossession of the lands or surrendered the same in favour of\n\niIlaqedar. It was held that though patta-lease – Ex.D-20 was\n\ngranted in favour of grandfather of the appellants, the appellants\n\nhave not adduced any evidence to prove abandonment of the\n\nlands in favour of iIlaqedar and no right accrued to the appellants\n\non the basis of the patta (Ex.D-20). Being aggrieved, the\n\nappellants have preferred this appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                    6</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">\f8.

The point falling for consideration is whether the High Court\n\nwas right in upholding the judgment of the first Appellate Court by\n\nobserving that in the absence of any order of abandonment or\n\nrevocation of the patta given to the respondents-plaintiffs, grant of\n\npatta (Ex.D-20) in 1929 in favour of the appellants-defendants was\n\nillegal and that the appellants-defendants cannot claim right based\n\nupon Ex.D-20 and other documents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1191372\" id=\"span_10\">10.   The impugned judgment of the High Court is the concurrent\n\nfinding of the High Court and the first Appellate Court.

When the finding of the first\n\nAppellate court and the High Court are shown to be perverse, this\n\nCourt would certainly interfere with the findings of fact recorded by\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                  7</span>\n\fthe High Court.

The appellants-defendants resisted the suit contending that\n\nRam Raj Singh was the original owner of the lands but he was\n\nnot cultivating the lands and settlement patta was given in the\n\nname of the fathers of respondents namely Ram Sahai and\n\nRameshwar on the basis of Batai-crop sharing at the time of\n\nsettlement and the predecessors of respondents-plaintiffs have\n\nnot cultivated the lands. The appellants-defendants further\n\naverred that the forefathers of respondents-plaintiffs abandoned\n\nthe suit lands and since revenue tax was not paid, the lease of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                   8</span>\n\fthe suit lands in favour of respondents-plaintiffs was cancelled.\n\nThe then illaqedar accepted the bid of the defendant’s father\n\nGaya Din in the auction held in the year 1929-Samvat 1986. The\n\nappellants-defendants have claimed ownership and possession\n\nover the lands in dispute on the basis of the patta Ex.D-20 (Ex. P-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">21) that was issued in their favour in Samvat 1986 (1929 A.D.)\n\nand averred that since then they are in possession of the\n\ndisputed lands.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">13.   The suit of the respondents-plaintiffs is for declaration of\n\ntheir title to the suit lands and consequential delivery of the suit\n\nlands. Having filed the suit for declaration of title, the plaintiffs\n\ncould succeed in their suit only by adducing sufficient evidence to\n\nestablish their title. But the plaintiffs have not produced the patta\n\ngranted to their fathers.    PW-1-Vishwanath, in his deposition,\n\nstated that the original patta was very old, torn and the same is\n\nnot with them. The respondents-plaintiffs have produced the\n\nreport of the Revenue Inspector dated 05.10.1969 (Ex. P-3) as\n\nper which on the application of Vishwanath, an enquiry was made\n\nand it was found that the name of pattedar is Gaya Din. Gaya\n\nDin and Shiv Nath are shown as lease holders. In Ex.P-3, it is\n\nfurther stated that in Khatauni No.58/59, it was found that names\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                   9</span>\n\fof Ram Sahai and Rameshwar Kurmi are found recorded as\n\nowners of land numbers 51/1.38, 162/0.17, 163/3.72, 164/2.65\n\nand 131/2.70. It was further stated that the patta illaqa of the\n\nabove numbers are found registered in the name of Gaya Din.\n\nEx.P-3-report notes the entries in Ex.D-20-patta to the effect that\n\npermission to make entry in respect of the patta granted vide\n\norder No.146/1960 dated 21.11.1960 issued by the Tahsildar in\n\nthe official record has been given after due inspection and entry\n\nin khasra is found made by the concerned Patwari on 10.01.1961.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"123401091\" id=\"span_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"96229\" id=\"span_15\">14.   In his evidence, PW-1 has stated that patta-lease was\n\nissued in the name of his father.        In his written statement,\n\ndefendant Hanuman Din also admitted that the plaintiffs-\n\nrespondents’ fathers were lessees and patta-lease was originally\n\ngranted in their favour during the settlement period for cultivation\n\non the basis of Batai-crop sharing. The trial court as well as the\n\nfirst appellate court held that the lease was granted in favour of\n\nfather of respondents-plaintiffs at time of the settlement and they\n\nwere held to be original lessees. The trial court while deciding\n\nissue No.2(A), observed that the grant of lease in the name of\n\nfather of respondents-plaintiffs in the settlement is not rebutted by\n\nthe appellants-defendants. Drawing our attention to the findings\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                  10</span>\n\fof the trial court that patta was granted in favour of the father of\n\nthe respondents-plaintiffs, the learned senior counsel for the\n\nrespondents-plaintiffs submitted that this amounts to admission\n\nand in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1143279/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 58</a> of the Evidence Act, admitted facts\n\nneed not be proved. Placing reliance upon <a href=\"/doc/96229/\" id=\"a_5\">Nagindas Ramdas v.\n\nDalpatram Iccharam</a> alias <a href=\"/doc/123401091/\" id=\"a_6\">Brijram and others (1974) 1 SCC\n\n242 and Executive Officer, Arulmigu Chokkanatha Swamy\n\nKoil Trust, Virudhunagar v. Chandran and others</a> (2017) 3\n\nSCC 702, it was submitted that in view of clear admission of grant\n\nof lease in the name of father of respondents-plaintiffs, the said\n\nadmitted fact need not be proved.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">15.   <a href=\"/doc/1143279/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 58</a> of the Evidence Act, no doubt, postulates that\n\nthe things admitted need not be proved. However, proviso to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1143279/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 58</a> of the Evidence Act gives full discretion to the court to\n\nrequire the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such\n\nadmission. When the respondents-plaintiffs have filed the suit for\n\ndeclaration of their title, the respondents-plaintiffs cannot isolate\n\nfew sentences in the written statement and take advantage of\n\nonly those part of the written statement which are favourable to\n\nthem. The written statement filed by the appellants-defendants\n\nhas to be read in toto. It is pertinent to note that in para No.(2) of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                   11</span>\n\fthe written statement, the appellants-defendants averred that the\n\nlands were in the ownership of Ram Raj Singh at the time of the\n\nsettlement, but because he was not in a position to cultivate the\n\nsame himself, the lands were given to the father of the\n\nrespondents-plaintiffs for cultivation on the basis of Batai-crop\n\nsharing. It is further averred that the then Halkedar cancelled the\n\nlease in respect of disputed lands and the same were auctioned\n\nin which the bid of the defendants’ father Gaya Din was accepted\n\nand the disputed lands were transferred in his name in the sale in\n\nSamvat 1986 i.e. 1929 A.D. The lease of the lands was issued in\n\nthe name of Gaya Din. The admission of the defendants as to\n\nthe lease of the plaintiffs’ father was the lease earlier granted in\n\nfavour of the forefathers of the respondents. In the light of the\n\npleadings and the oral and documentary evidence adduced by\n\nthe defendants, notwithstanding the admission in the written\n\nstatement, the burden lies upon the respondents-plaintiffs to\n\nprove that the patta-lease continues to be in their favour and that\n\nthey are the holders of patta and that they are in continued\n\npossession of the suit properties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">16.   In his cross-examination, PW-1 stated that his father left for\n\nJabalpur about forty years prior to the institution of the suit. In the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                    12</span>\n\fcross-examination, PW-1 however denied the suggestion that\n\nwhen his father left for Jabalpur, he handed over the disputed\n\nlands to Pawaidar and all the records at the relevant time were\n\nkept by the iIlaqedar. From the statement of PW-1-Vishwanath\n\nand PW-2-Ram Gopal, it is evident that the father of Vishwanath\n\nhad started living in Jabalpur forty years back prior to institution of\n\nthe suit and settled there. In the light of the evidence adduced,\n\nthe trial court rightly accepted the case of the defendants that in\n\nSamvat 1986 (1929 A.D.), in the auction held by Pawaidar for\n\nlease of suit lands and other lands, bid of Gaya Din was accepted\n\nand the suit properties along with other lands were given on lease\n\nto Gaya Din. We find substance in the submission of the learned\n\nsenior counsel for the appellants that if the lands were not left so\n\nabandoned by the father of respondents-plaintiffs, it would not\n\nhave been possible for the Pawaidar to auction the lease of the\n\nsuit lands and grant lease of the lands in favour of Gaya Din.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">17.   Case of the appellants-defendants that in Samvat 1986\n\n(1929 A.D.), in the auction held by Pawaidar for lease of suit\n\nlands and other lands, the suit properties along with other lands\n\nwere given on lease to Gaya Din, is strengthened by revenue\n\nrecords and ample evidence. The Pawaidar sanctioned entries\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                                    13</span>\n\fregarding grant of patta to Gaya Din to be made in the\n\nGovernment records. The appellants-defendants produced their\n\npatta-Ex.   D-20   which   has   also   been   produced    by   the\n\nrespondents-plaintiffs (Ex. P-21). Ex. D-20 is the patta kashtkari\n\nas per the order of the Hon’ble Shri Rai Saheb Churhat, Halka\n\nPatwari No.1, Region Churhat, State Rewa, Location Mauja\n\nKother, in Samvat 1986 in the name of Gaya Din as\n\nfarmer/cultivator for the suit properties granted for agricultural\n\npurpose. From Ex. D-20, it is seen that as per Tahsildar order\n\nNo.146/1960 dated 21.11.1960, Pawaidar has been allowed to\n\nenter in government serial. As per the order of the Tahsildar,\n\nentry has been made accordingly in Pawai Khasra as is clear\n\nfrom the endorsement made by Patwari dated 10.01.1961 in\n\nEx.D-20.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">18.   Ex. D-20-patta in favour of Gaya Din was validly granted by\n\nthe iIIaqedar to Gaya Din in the year 1929. The said documents\n\nissued by the Tahsildar were produced from the custody of the\n\nappellants. The contents thereon show that as per the\n\nGovernment records, the lands had been given to Gaya Din. The\n\ndocuments being more than thirty years old, the trial court rightly\n\npresumed the Ex.D-20-patta of genuine. It was then up to the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                14</span>\n\frespondents to rebut the presumption.         This has not been\n\ncontroverted by the respondents-plaintiffs.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">19.    Ex. D-20 being thirty year old document gives rise to\n\npresumption    as   to   its   genuineness.   Contention   of   the\n\nrespondents-plaintiffs is that <a href=\"/doc/1507394/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 90</a> of the Evidence Act has\n\nno application to Ex. D-20 and the presumption cannot be raised\n\nas to the genuineness of the contents of the document. <a href=\"/doc/1507394/\" id=\"a_10\">Section\n\n90</a> of the Evidence Act enables the court to draw presumption\n\nabout the genuineness of the document which is thirty years old.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1507394/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 90</a> lays down that the court “may presume” that the\n\ndocument is genuine. Since the patta granted in favour of Gaya\n\nDin is of Samvat 1986 (1929 A.D.) which is more than thirty years\n\nold, <a href=\"/doc/1507394/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 90</a> raises presumption as to the authenticity of the\n\ndocument. Mere allegations of fraud would not be sufficient to\n\nrebut the presumption raised under <a href=\"/doc/1507394/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 90</a> of the Evidence\n\nAct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">20.    The respondents-plaintiffs have produced the copies of\n\nkhasras of several years. However, only the copies of khasra for\n\nthe years 1955-56 (Ex. P-9) and 1956-57 (Ex. P-10) are in the\n\nname of respondents-plaintiffs; and in the previous khasras for\n\nthe years 1950-51 to 1954-55 (Ex. P-8) and subsequent khasras\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                                15</span>\n\ffor 1960-61 (Ex. P-12), 1963-64 to 1965-66 (Ex. P-13), 1968-69\n\n(Ex. P-14) and 1970-71 to 1975 (Ex. D-2), the entries are in the\n\nname of the father of the appellants-defendants. The lease was\n\ngranted in favour of Gaya Din and that he and Hanuman Din had\n\nbeen continuously in possession of the properties is thus\n\nestablished by the revenue records.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">21.   From perusal of the Khatauni for the year 1952-53 (Ex.P-2)\n\nproduced by the plaintiffs, it is seen that the appellants-\n\ndefendants are in possession of the suit lands from the year\n\n1950-51 to       1954-55 (Ex. P-8) and thereafter, the subsequent\n\nkhasras 1960-61 onwards.        The names of the appellants-\n\ndefendants being mentioned in the khasra 1950-51 to 1954-55 is\n\nvery crucial.   The reason being <a href=\"/doc/67246421/\" id=\"a_14\">Vindhya Pradesh Abolition of\n\nJagirs and Land Reforms Act, 1952</a> (Vindhya Pradesh Act) came\n\ninto force on 30.07.1953.     Ex. D-20 (Ex. P-21) - lease was\n\ngranted in favour of the predecessors of the appellants-\n\ndefendants namely Gaya Din by Pawaidar under Section 44 of\n\nthe Rewa State Malgujari and Kashtkari Act, 1935 (Rewa Land\n\nRevenue and Tenancy Act, 1935). After referring to Ex. D-20, the\n\ntrial court rightly held that the Pawaidar was empowered to issue\n\nthe lease and that lease           (Ex. D-20) was issued under\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                               16</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/181136/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 141</a> of the Act. It was therefore rightly held by the trial\n\ncourt that the lease (Ex. D-20) is valid and that the appellants-\n\ndefendants have proved that the lease of the lands was legally\n\ngiven by illaqedar in favour of their father.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">22.   The revenue records produced by the appellants for several\n\nyears amply strengthen the case of the appellants that patta\n\n(Ex. D-20) was granted to them and that they are in possession of\n\nthe suit properties for several years. The oral and documentary\n\nevidence clearly establish that the father of the respondents-\n\nplaintiffs has abandoned the suit properties, pursuant to which,\n\nauction was held by the Pawaidar and lease was issued by\n\nillaqedar in favour of Gaya Din and that he was in continuous\n\npossession of the suit properties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">23.   In the plaint, the respondents/plaintiffs have alleged that\n\nEx. D-20-patta is a forged one. In para No.(4) of the plaint, it is\n\nalleged that without knowledge of the respondents/plaintiffs’\n\nfather, defendants’ father Gaya Din got the lease from Ilaqa\n\nChurhat by illegal means and Gaya Din never remained in\n\npossession of the properties. The respondents-plaintiffs have not\n\nproduced any document to prove that Ex. D-20 is a forged one.\n\nThe plaintiffs at one place averred that without the knowledge of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                                17</span>\n\fthe plaintiffs and their father, Gaya Din succeeded in getting the\n\nlease by illegal means of the disputed lands from iIlaqa therein;\n\nwhereas in para No.(5), the respondents-plaintiffs alleged that the\n\ndocument is a forged one. In fact, as pointed out earlier, the\n\nrespondents themselves have filed the patta granted in favour of\n\nthe appellants-defendants. It is pertinent to note that Vishwanath\n\nhad given an application for inspection of the area (patta) in\n\nrespect of land numbers 41, 131, 162, 163 and 164 situated in\n\nVillage Bairath.   The Collector called for the report from the\n\nRevenue Inspector and as per the Report of the Revenue\n\nInspector (Ex. P-3), though the names of Ram Sahai and\n\nRameshwar are found recorded as owners of the said lands,\n\npatta illaqa of the above land numbers was found registered in\n\nthe name of Gaya Din. The report of the Revenue Inspector\n\nrefers to the entry in respect of patta granted vide order\n\nNo.146/1960 dated 21.11.1960 issued by the Tahsildar. It also\n\nrefers to entry in khasra made by the concerned Patwari on\n\n10.01.1961 which is in possession of Hanuman Din-predecessor\n\nof the appellants. Ex. P-3-Report of Revenue Inspector states\n\nthat the patta-Ex. D-20 was granted in favour of Gaya Din.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                18</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">\f24.   The entries which are consistently in favour of the\n\nappellants ought not to have been ignored in preference to the\n\nentries in favour of the respondents only for two years i.e. 1955-\n\n56 and      1956-57. Moreover, in the light of the findings by the\n\nrevenue authorities on several occasions, the said entries in the\n\nname of the respondents cannot be said to be genuine. The first\n\nAppellate Court and the High Court were not right in brushing\n\naside Ex. P-21 (Ex.D-20) patta granted in the name of the\n\nappellants and other crucial documents like report of the Revenue\n\nInspector (Ex. P-3) which notes that patta illaqa is in the name of\n\nGaya Din and the several entries in the revenue records are in\n\nthe name of the appellants.         In the absence of the contra\n\nevidence adduced by the respondents-plaintiffs, the trial court\n\nrightly held that the appellants have been in continuous\n\npossession of the suit properties and that the respondents have\n\nfailed to prove their right over the suit properties prior to filing of\n\nthe suit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_28\">25.

In revision against the order of the Collector, the\n\nCommissioner vide order dated 17.07.1973 upheld the order of\n\nTahsildar observing that from perusal of SDO’s report dated\n\n21.10.1969 and the order of Tahsildar dated 28.07.1971, the\n\nmischief of patwari was proved beyond shadow of doubt. These\n\norders were not challenged by the plaintiffs-respondents and are\n\nbinding on them.

A perusal of the records of the lower courts reveals that\n     N.A.

The application was\n     sent to SDO for enquiry. SDO reported vide his report dated\n     21.10.1969 that the allegations are true and the patwari was\n     guilty of grave misconduct. The charge of interpolation is\n     amply proved. Collector also found the report to be true,\n     but ordered that Tehsildar should hear the opposite party\n     before ordering correction (Order Sheet dated 23.10.1969).\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">     Tehsildar held the enquiry and on the basis of documents\n     and oral evidence ordered correction of khasra entries for\n     the year 1963-64 to 1968-69 vide his order dated 28.07.1971.\n     The perusal of SDO’s report dated 21.10.1969 and the order\n     of Tehsildar dated 28.07.1971 reveals that the mischief of\n     patwari was proved beyond a shadow of doubt. The order\n     passed by the Tehsildar has to be treated as administrative in\n     nature and cannot be set aside<a href=\"/doc/1610983/\" id=\"a_16\"> u/s 50</a> of the M.P.

After all,\n     patwari cannot be the final arbiter of the destinies of cultivators.”\n\nFrom the above order of the Commissioner and the report of the\n\nother revenue authorities, it is clear that the plaintiffs-respondents\n\nhave made interpolation in the revenue entries in connivance with\n\nPatwari and got the revenue entries recorded in their names.

Based upon such enquiry and report of\n\nthe SDO dated 21.10.1969, the Tahsildar held that the entry in\n\nregard to possession of the non-applicants (Vishwanath, Shiv\n\nNath, Jairaj Kumari) in respect of land numbers 41, 131, 162, 163\n\nwas found to be made subsequently and held as under:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">     “9.

We find no merit in the contention that the\n\norder of the Tahsildar dated 28.07.1971 cannot be looked into on\n\nthe ground that they were not adduced as evidence before the\n\ntrial court. Order of the Commissioner, Rewa in Case No.52A\n\n61/71-73 marked as Ex. D-1 dated 17.07.1973 makes a clear\n\nreference to the order of the Tahsildar dated 28.07.1971.

The order of the Tahsildar dated 28.07.1971 has a\n\ndirect bearing on the main issue in the suit and in the interest of\n\njustice, the same has to be received as additional evidence.\n\nSince Ex.

Since the order of the Tahsildar has been\n\nreferred to in the order of the Commissioner dated 17.07.1973\n\n(Ex.D-1), in our view, it will not have the effect of introducing new\n\ncase necessitating remittance of the matter.

Limitation:- The respondents’ suit was for the reliefs of\n\ndeclaration of title and consequential possession of the suit lands.\n\nThe suit was instituted on 17.10.1975. The appellants contended\n\nthat the suit is hopelessly time barred as according to them, the\n\ncause of action arose for the first time in the year 1929, when the\n\npatta was issued in favour of the appellants’ grandfather Gaya\n\nDin and then in the year 1935, when the Act was promulgated by\n\nthe Maharaja of Rewa and then in the year 1952, when Jagirdari\n\nwas abolished and Hanuman Din became the tenant of the State\n\ninstead of Jagirdar and lastly on 02.11.1960, when the name of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                                 29</span>\n\fHanuman Din was entered by the Tahsildar as bhumiswami. By\n\ndismissing    the    suit,   the   trial   court   held      that   the\n\nrespondents/plaintiffs must have filed the suit within twelve years\n\nof possession of the defendants or dispossession of the plaintiffs.\n\nIn the plaint, the respondents have averred that they came to\n\nknow about the lease of the lands in favour of Gaya Din only in\n\nthe month of August, 1969 whereas the first Appellate Court held\n\nthat the suit was within the period of limitation of twelve years by\n\ntreating the cause of action to have arisen on 06.11.1974 i.e. on\n\nthe date of order of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate in <a href=\"/doc/1110615/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 145</a>\n\nproceedings.

On that date, illaqedar was\n\nnot authorised and was not having jurisdiction to issue patta. The\n\nmerit of the contention is to be considered in the light of the\n\nprovisions of Rewa Land Revenue and Tenancy Act, 1935 (Rewa\n\nAct) and Vindhya Pradesh Act, 1952.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                                                     30</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">\f35.   The learned senior counsel for the appellants stated that in\n\n1929, there was no codified revenue law in the State of Rewa. In\n\n1935, Maharaja of Rewa promulgated the Rewa Land Revenue\n\nand Tenancy Act, 1935. Section 2 of the Rewa Act repealed all\n\nearlier government notices, rules, circulars, orders, notifications\n\netc. that are inconsistent to the said Act; but saved the action\n\ntaken thereunder. Thus, the action taken thereunder the said Act\n\nlike grant of patta etc. was saved.      Case of the appellants-\n\ndefendants is that by virtue of Section 2 of the Rewa Act, grant of\n\npatta to Gaya Din is saved. It is also their case that Section 3 of\n\nthe Rewa Act saved the existing proceedings and the fathers of\n\nthe respondents could have proceeded against the appellants\n\nunder Sections 46 and 142 of the Rewa Act. However, they have\n\nnot initiated any proceedings under the said provisions of the Act.\n\nIn 1948, the State of Rewa acceded to India and became part of\n\nthe State of Vindhya Pradesh. In 1952, the State of Vindhya\n\nPradesh abolished the system of Jagirdari by the <a href=\"/doc/67246421/\" id=\"a_31\">Vindhya\n\nPradesh Abolition of Jagirs and Land Reforms Act, 1952</a>.

The learned senior counsel for the respondents-plaintiffs\n\nsubmitted that upon consideration of the evidence of Hanuman\n\nDin (DW-1), the first appellate court recorded a finding of fact that\n\nin the year 1954, patta was granted in favour of Gaya Din\n\n(defendants’ father) and as per the testimony of Hanuman Din\n\n(DW-1), when patta was issued, Hanuman Din was 35 years old.\n\nIt was submitted that based on the evidence of Hanuman Din, the\n\nfirst appellate court recorded finding that patta was granted in\n\nfavour of Gaya Din in the year 1954 by which time, the tradition of\n\nPawai has been removed and therefore, patta granted in favour\n\nof Gaya Din is not a valid one. The first appellate court arrived at\n\nsuch a finding without proper facts and by drawing an inference\n\nnoting that when DW-1 was examined in 1984, he was aged 65\n\nyears from which the first Appellate Court inferred that DW-1 must\n\nhave been born in 1919. Referring to the statement of DW-1 that\n\nwhen patta was issued, he was aged 35 years, the first appellate\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                                                    33</span>\n\fcourt inferred that patta must have been issued in 1954 (DW-1\n\nborn in 1919 + 35=1954) and by that time, system of Pawai had\n\nbeen removed. In this regard, the learned senior counsel for the\n\nrespondents-plaintiffs submitted that as per Section 5 of the\n\nVindhya Pradesh Act, all the Jagir Lands were resumed in the\n\nthen Vindhya Pradesh Government on 23.06.1953, hence, on this\n\ndate, Pawaidar/iIlaqedar/Jagirdar were not authorised and were\n\nnot having jurisdiction to issue patta and therefore, the finding of\n\nthe first appellate court that the patta issued in the name of Gaya\n\nDin in the year 1954 is not a valid one and the said findings of\n\nfact cannot be interfered with.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_56\">39.   The finding of the first appellate court that the patta was\n\ngranted to Gaya Din in 1954 and that illaqedar was not competent\n\nto issue patta is misconceived. As discussed earlier, patta was\n\ngranted to Gaya Din not in 1954 but in Samvat 1986 (1929 A.D.)\n\nwhen admittedly the illaqedar had such power. That apart, the\n\nvalidity of patta so granted cannot be determined based on the\n\ninference drawn as to the age of DW-1-Hanuman Din.             The\n\nlearned senior counsel appearing for the appellants has drawn\n\nour attention to the provisions of Vindhya Pradesh Act and\n\nsubmitted that as per <a href=\"/doc/94717/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 5</a> of the said Act, the State\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                                                 34</span>\n\fGovernment by a notification appointed a date for the resumption\n\nof any class of Jagir Lands and the consequences of such\n\nresumption are set out in <a href=\"/doc/1536853/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 6</a> of the said Act.

The burden is on the plaintiffs-respondents to\n\nestablish their title to the suit properties to show that they are\n\nentitled for a decree for declaration. The plaintiffs-respondents\n\nhave neither produced the title document i.e. patta-lease which\n\nthe plaintiffs-respondents are relying upon nor proved their right\n\nby adducing any other evidence. As noted above, the revenue\n\nentries relied on by them are also held to be not genuine. In any\n\nevent, revenue entries for few Khataunis are not proof of title; but\n\nare mere statements for revenue purpose. They cannot confer\n\nany right or title on the party relying on them for proving their title.\n\nObserving that in a suit for declaration of title, the plaintiffs-\n\nrespondents are to succeed only on the strength of their own title\n\nirrespective of whether the defendants-appellants have proved\n\ntheir case or not, in <a href=\"/doc/163718602/\" id=\"a_44\">Union of India and others v.

Upon appreciation of evidence, the trial court has recorded\n\nfindings on various issues which was reversed by the first\n\nAppellate Court.         Since the first Appellate Court reversed the\n\njudgment of the trial court, in the second appeal, the High Court\n\nought to have weighed and considered the evidence and\n\nmaterials. The order of the High Court dismissing the appellant’s\n\nappeal by affirming the findings of the first Appellate Court is\n\nmainly on the ground that in the absence of any order of\n\nabandonment or revocation of the patta granted to the\n\nrespondents-plaintiffs, grant of patta (Ex.D-20) in favour of the\n\nappellants-defendants was illegal. The High Court, in our view,\n\ndid not appreciate the patta (Ex.D-20) granted in favour of the\n\nforefathers of the appellants by the competent authority in 1929\n\nand the report of the Revenue Inspector dated 05.10.1969. The\n\nfirst Appellate Court and the High Court did not consider Ex.D-1-\n\nOrder of the Commissioner dated 17.07.1973 and the report of\n\nthe SDO dated 21.10.1969 and other revenue records showing\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                                                  38</span>\n\fthat the forefather of the appellants-defendants namely Gaya Din\n\nwas given the patta (Ex.D-20) and since then, Gaya Din and\n\nHanuman Din were in possession of the properties. The High\n\nCourt has not properly appreciated the evidence and materials on\n\nrecord and the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">43.   In the result, the judgment of the High Court in the Second\n\nAppeal No.174 of 1989 dated 05.02.2007 is set aside and this\n\nappeal is allowed.
