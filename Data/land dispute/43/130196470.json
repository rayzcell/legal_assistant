The factual matrix involved has a chequered history. The\n\nappellant in W.A.

Appellants in W.A.No.17/2020\n\nare Gwalior Development Authority (for short &quot;the GDA&quot;).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.     Notified Development Scheme was finally published under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/116699358/\" id=\"a_2\">section 50(7)</a> of the M.P. Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh Adhiniyam\n\n1973 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Adhiniyam of 1973&quot;) known\n\nas &quot;Maharajpur Residential Scheme&quot; in Official Gazette on\n\n20/1/1989.       Under <a href=\"/doc/116233493/\" id=\"a_3\">section 56</a> of the Adhiniyam, the GDA\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                 3</span>\n\nproceeded to acquire land by way of agreements. Amongst others,\n\nthe GDA entered into two agreements dated 23/11/1996 and\n\n28/12/1997 with the Housing Society in respect of the notified\n\nland situated at Village Mow. The agreement dated 23/11/1996\n\nwas entered into in respect of land falling in Survey Nos. 858/2\n\nmin admeasuring 5 Bigha, 850/1 min admeasuring 7 bigha, total\n\n12 bigha 4 biswa, whereas agreement dated 28/12/1997 was in\n\nrespect of lands falling in Survey No.858 Min area 1 bigha,\n\nSurvey No.386 min area 13 bigha 13 biswa, Survey No.412/1 area\n\n2 bigha, Survey No.498 area 2 bigha 6 biswa, 373/2 area 2 bigha 9\n\nbiswa, Survey No.388 admeasuring 20 bigha 6 biswa, Survey No.\n\n375 area 4 bigha 10 biswa, Survey No.374 area 0.10 biswa,\n\nSurvey No. area 09 total area 47 bigha 3 biswa.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">4.    As such, under the agreement dated 23/11/1996, 12 bigha\n\nand 4 biswa and under agreement dated 28/12/1997, 47 bigha 3\n\nbiswa, total 59 bigha 7 biswa of land was surrendered. For the\n\npurpose of disposal of these appeals, the land falling in Survey\n\nNo.388 admeasuring 20 bigha 6 biswa under the agreement dated\n\n28/12/1997 is relevant (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;disputed\n\nland&quot;).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">5.    On 24/12/1997, the Housing Society entered into an\n\nagreement to sell with Kamal Singh (appellant no.1 in W.A.\n\nNo.16/2020) in respect of the disputed land. Thereafter, on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                      4</span>\n\n28/12/1997, a tripartite agreement was entered into between the\n\nHousing Society, owner of disputed land and other owners of\n\ndifferent lands of different survey numbers falling          within the\n\nscope of notified scheme on one side and GDA on the other side.\n\nIt was agreed thereunder to allot 25% of plots out of the total\n\ndeveloped area from the surrendered land to the Housing Society.\n\nDuring the period 29/6/1998 to 2/6/2000, developed plots\n\ncomprising area 3216 square meters and 11886 square meters were\n\nallotted to the Housing Society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">6.    It appears that with the passage of time as the land prices\n\nincreased, some dispute arose between the Housing Society and\n\nowner of disputed land. According to GDA, an application dated\n\n24/5/2017 was received supported by an affidavit of President of\n\nSociety    dated   19/5/2017,   to       exclude   the   disputed   land\n\nadmeasuring 17 bigha 6 biswa from the tripartite agreement. On\n\n25/9/2018, the GDA replied and expressed its inability to release\n\nSurvey No.388 area 17 bigha 6 biswa out of total area of 20 bigha\n\n6 biswa for the reason that the Housing Society had already\n\nreceived possession of the developed plots more than its\n\nentitlement to the extent of 8190 square meter. It was also stated\n\nthereunder that 3 bigha land out of Survey No.388 had already\n\nbeen released in the shape of developed plots to the Housing\n\nSociety.   The value thereof, as per Collector guidelines,was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                       5</span>\n\ncalculated as 8,19,85,000/-. For ready reference, the rejection\n\norder (relevant part) dated 25/9/2018 (Annexure P/8) passed by\n\nthe GDA is quoted infra:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      &quot;vkids }kjk vuqcaf/kr Hkwfe losZ dz- 388 jdok 20 ch?kk 06\n      foLok esa ls 17 ch?kk 06 foLok Hkwfe dk vuqca/k fujLr djus\n      gsrq &#x27;kiFk irz layXu dj nwljk vkosnu izLrqr fd;k gS] tks\n      eqDr fd;k tkuk laHko ugha gS] D;ksafd vkids }kjk izkf/kdj.k\n      ls ikrzrk ls vf/kd Hkw[k.M izkIr dj fy;s gSa A ftldk\n      {ksrzQy 8198-00 oxZehVj vf/kd gS] ftldh dher orZeku\n      dysDVj xkbZM ykbZu ls :i;s 8 djksM 19 yk[k 85 gtkj\n      gksrh gS A&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">As such, the GDA called upon the Housing Society to ensure\n\nmutation of the disputed land in favour of the GDA in the revenue\n\nrecords or else pay the aforesaid amount, failing which the GDA\n\nwould initiate action for cancellation of plots allotted and also\n\ninitiate criminal prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">7.

In the said order,\n\nGDA has narrated the entire factual matrix in relation to tripartite\n\nagreement etc. and reached the conclusion that after release of 16\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                           6</span>\n\nbigha 4 biswa of land out of the disputed land, for excess\n\nallotment to the tune of 21030 square meters to the Housing\n\nSociety, a sum of Rs.1,68,24,000/- be deposited with the GDA.\n\nRelevant portion of the order is quoted below :-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            &quot;¼1½ laLFkk }kjk iwoZ esa fnukad 26-05-2017 dks &#x27;kiFk i=\n            fnukad 19-05-2017 lfgr vkosnu izLrqr dj xzke eÅ dh\n            Hkwfe losZ Ø- 388 jdok 20 ch?kk 06 foLok esa ls 17 ch?kk\n            03 foLok dks vuqcU/k ls eqDr djus dk vkosnu fn;k x;k\n            Fkk tks uLrh esa fu.kZ; gsrq yfEcr FkkA laLFkk ds bl\n            yfEcr vkosnu dk fujkdj.k vkosnu Lohdkj djrs gq,\n            fnukad 29-05-2019 dks xzke eÅ dh Hkwfe losZ Ø- 388 esa\n            ls 16 ch?kk 04 foLok dks vuqcU/k ls eqDr dj fn;k x;kA\n            ¼2½ laLFkk }kjk blh nkSjku xzke eÅ dh Hkwfe losZ Ø- 386\n            ,oa 388 jdok 28 ch?kk 09 foLok dk ukekUrj.k jktLo\n            vfHkys[kksa esa izkf/kdj.k ds uke djk fn;k x;k ftlesa ls\n            Hkwfe 16 ch?kk 04 foLok Hkwfe mijksDr fcUnq Øekad 01 ds\n            vuqlj laLFkk ds i{k esa mlds vkosnu ds vk/kkj ij\n            fnukad 29-05-2019 dks mijksDrkuqlkj eqDr dj nh xbZ\n            bl izdkj &#x27;ks&quot;k 12 ch?kk 05 foLok fof/kor~ izkf/kdj.k dks\n            lefiZr fd;s tkus dh Js.kh esa vk tkus ls bl Hkwfe dks Hkh\n            x.kuk esa fy;k tk jgk gSA\n                      bl izdkj orZeku fLFkfr vuqlkj laLFkk dks 21\n            ch?kk 09 foLok iwoZ esa fof/kor~ lefiZr ekU; dh xbZ Hkwfe\n            rFkk i&#x27;pkr~orhZ dk;Zokgh ds nkSjku 12 ch?kk 05 foLok\n            fof/kor~ ekU; dh xbZ Hkwfe dqy Hkwfe 33 ch?kk 14 foLok\n            vFkkZr~ 758250 oxZQhV Hkwfe laLFkk }kjk fof/kor~ izkf/kdj.k\n            dks lkSaih tkdj jktLo vfHkys[kksa esa ukekUrj.k djk;k\n            x;kA mDr Hkwfe ds cnys laLFkk dks vuqcU/kksa &#x27;krksZa vuqlkj\n            25 izfr&#x27;kr fodflr Hkw[k.M vFkkZr~ 189563 oxZQhV\n            Hkw[k.M      vkoafVr   fd;s       tkus   Fks   ftlds   fo:)\n            izkf/kdj.k      }kjk 210593 oxZQhV vkoafVr fd;s tk pqds\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                       7</span>\n\n            gSa bl izdkj izkf/kdj.k }kjk laLFkk dks 21030 oxZQhV\n            vfrfjDr Hkw[k.M vkoafVr fd;s x;s ftuds         cnys      esa\n            laLFkk }kjk uk rks dksbZ Hkwfe izkf/kdj.k dks lefiZr dh xbZ\n            vkSj uk gh mDr Hkwfe dk ewY; izkf/kdj.k dks Hkqxrku\n            fd;k x;kA\n                    vr% laLFkk dks funsZf&#x27;kr fd;k tkrk gS fd 21030\n            oxZQhV Hkwfe dk orZeku dysDVj xkbZM ykbZu vuqlkj\n            jkf&#x27;k 1]68]24]000@&amp; izkf/kdj.k dks ,d ekg ds Hkhrj\n            Hkqxrku djs vU;Fkk mDr jkf&#x27;k Hkw jktLo ds cdk;k dh\n            Hkk¡fr olwy dh tkosxhA&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">8.    Thereafter, on 7/6/2019 an agreement was entered into\n\nbetween owner of disputed land Kamal Singh and GDA under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/116233493/\" id=\"a_4\">section 56</a> of the Adhiniyam in respect of 16 bigha 4 biswa of land\n\nand on 3/9/2019, 25% of developed plots were released to him.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">9.    The Housing Society filed W.P. No.19912/2019 (subject\n\nmatter of these appeals) challenging orders dated 28/8/2019 and\n\n3/9/2019. The owner of disputed land filed an application for\n\ndismissal of the writ petition on the premise that the Housing\n\nSociety did not come to the Court with clean hands. The right,\n\ntitle and interest over the disputed land continued to be that of\n\nowner of the disputed land. There was no sale or transfer of land\n\nin favour of the Housing Society, therefore, the Society had no\n\nauthority to deal with the disputed land in any manner whatsoever\n\nincluding to enter agreement with the GDA in respect thereof in\n\nthe context of the development scheme. The alleged cancellation\n\nagreement dated 15/5/2017 along with affdiavit of President of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                 8</span>\n\nHousing Society submitted in the GDA is another forged act of the\n\nHousing Society. The owner of disputed land had never signed\n\nsuch an agreement. The agreement is of 15/5/2017 and affidavit is\n\nof 19/5/2017. In any case, the Housing Society had no authority to\n\ndeal with the disputed land.    The owner of disputed land had\n\napproached the GDA, as acknowledged by the GDA, and therefore\n\nagreement was entered on 7/6/2019. Thereafter 16 bigha 4 biswa\n\nland was surrendered to the GDA and in lieu thereof, on 3/9/2019,\n\n25% developed plots were allotted to him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">10.   On notice, the GDA also filed a detailed reply and raised\n\npreliminary objection submitting that the Housing Society had not\n\ncome with clean hands. It had suppressed the fact of filing of\n\napplication before GDA for release/exemption of 17 bigha 6 biswa\n\nof land falling in Survey No.388 (disputed land). Thereafter, the\n\nGDA passed the order dated 25/9/2018 (Supra) and, as indicated\n\nabove, W.P. No.25258/2018 filed by the Housing Society was\n\ndecided on 4/12/2018 with the direction to the effect that if\n\npetitioner therein had sought extension of time to file reply and\n\nhad filed reply, the same would be decided by respondent\n\nno.3/GDA by passing a speaking order. It is further stated in the\n\nreply that the order passed by the GDA on 28/8/2019 is self\n\ncontained and explanatory. No indulgence was warranted in the\n\nsaid order. Since there is no illegality in the agreement entered\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                    9</span>\n\ninto between Kamal Singh (owner of the land) and the GDA on\n\n7/6/2019 in respect of 16 bigha 4 biswa of land falling in Survey\n\nNo.388, as a consequence thereof and in terms of that agreement,\n\nthe GDA agreed to and released/allotted 25% developed plots to\n\nhim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">11.    On the aforesaid pleadings of the parties, the learned Single\n\nJudge in paragraph 15 of the impugned judgment observed as\n\nunder:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       &quot;(15) The petitioner has alleged that forged documents\n       have been filed by the respondents no.2 and 3, whereas\n       the respondents no. 2 and 3 have alleged that the\n       petitioner has suppressed material facts.

The alleged letter\n\ndated 15/5/2017 which is said to be a deed of cancellation of\n\nagreements dated 15/12/1997 and 28/12/1997 is a manufactured\n\nand incomplete document and the same could not have been\n\nentered into for deleting Survey No.388 from the agreements of\n\n1997.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">        Learned counsel further contended that the learned Single\n\nJudge committed serious error of law and fact while holding that\n\nafter expiry of three years&#x27; period from the date of publication of\n\ndevelopment scheme, the GDA could not have acquired the land\n\nby agreements.

The G.D.A was free to execute an\n\nagreement with the actual owner of 16 bigha 4 biswa of Survey\n\nNo.388 with the Kamal Singh (owner of disputed land). This\n\nCourt has since already held that under Section 56 of the\n\nAdhiniyam of 1973 the process of acquisition may start within\n\nthree years, but not to be completed within three years, therefore,\n\nthe agreement between Kamal Singh (owner of disputed land) and\n\nthe G.D.A cannot be faulted with having been entered beyond the\n\nthree years of period from the date of final publication of the\n\ndevelopment scheme under <a href=\"/doc/703570/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 50</a> of the Adhiniyam of 1973.\n\nThe officers of the G.D.A have acted bonafidely either while\n\nexecuting the agreement dated 28.12.1997 or the agreement with\n\nKamal Singh on 7.6.2019. The observations of the learned Single\n\nJudge in the context of the conduct of the G.D.A        are wholly\n\nunwarranted for more than one reasons:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(i)   Once in para 15 of the impugned order the learned Single\n\nJudge has expressed that the subject matter of the writ petition\n\ninvolves disputed questions of facts and the same could not be\n\naddressed under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, no\n\nfurther observation could have been made against the officers.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                      17</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(ii)    None of the officers was either arrayed as respondent or\n\nafforded an opportunity before making serious remarks against\n\nthem in discharge of their duties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(iii)   The documents available on record do not suggest that the\n\nofficers of the G.D.A resorted to colourable exercise of powers or\n\nacted with ulterior motive and for collateral purposes.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(iv)    The observations qua enquiry and direction for registration\n\nof FIR by the S.P.E (Lokayukt) to investigate the matter and\n\nthereafter prosecute the persons found guilty are directions much\n\nbeyond the scope of the writ petition in the obtaining facts and\n\ncircumstances. The G.D.A has taken decisions in accordance\n\nwith law and with due approval of the competent Authorities,\n\nhence no exception thereto could have been taken to the aforesaid\n\nextent, that too without hearing the persons affected by the\n\nimpugned order. With the aforesaid submissions, learned counsel\n\nprays for setting aside of the impugned order.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">15.     Besides, learned counsel for the appellants in all the three\n\nappeals have made a common submission that learned Single\n\nJudge, on misreading of S.56 of the Adhiniyam of 1973 and in\n\nignorance of the corresponding Rule 20(4)(a) &amp; (b) of the Rules of\n\n2012, has stretched out of self imposed limitation in exercise of\n\nextraordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution\n\nwhile issuing command for cancellation of allotment; recovery of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                     18</span>\n\npossession of plots; initiation of enquiry by the Registrar Co-\n\noperative Society and registration of FIR, in absence of pleadings\n\nand material to that effect on record. It has further been contended\n\nthat the lopsided findings are based on surmises and conjectures,\n\ntherefore, the impugned order be set aside. The impugned order\n\npassed in purported exercise of powers under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution has resulted in miscarriage of justice being out of\n\nbounds of the contours of fair play, justice, equity and good\n\nconscience.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">16.   Before adverting to contentions advanced by learned\n\ncounsel for the parties, it is expedient to address on the question of\n\ninterpretation of S.56 of the Adhiniyam of 1973 and the\n\ncorresponding Rule 20 of the Rules of 2012.

The\n\naforesaid view of this Court is fortified by the judgment of a co-\n\nordinate Bench of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1932918/\" id=\"a_31\">Sanjai Gandhi Grah\n\nNirman Sahkari Sanstha Maryadit Vs. State of M.P.</a> (AIR\n\n1991 MP 72), as couched in the following paragraphs:-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">     &quot;18........Section 56 of the Adhiniyam provides that\n     after the date of publication of the final scheme under\n     <a href=\"/doc/703570/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 50</a> the Authority may proceed to acquire the\n     land required for the implementation of the scheme\n     within a period of three years by agreement and if\n     there is a failure in acquiring the land by agreement\n     then request for the acquisition of the land may be\n     made to the authority. Then Section 57 provides for\n     the development which clearly says that when the land\n     has vested in the Authority under <a href=\"/doc/7832/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 56</a> of the Act\n     in accordance with the provisions of the Town\n     Development Scheme, the authority shall take\n     necessary steps to develop the land. Thereafter also\n     the State Government or the Director has a\n     supervisory power to ensure that the development is in\n     accordance with the scheme and may also issue\n     directions to the authority which are binding on the\n     authority. As such the aforesaid provisions made in the\n     Adhiniyam have to be taken into consideration before\n     interpreting the word &#x27;implementation.&#x27;\n            After a scheme is published under <a href=\"/doc/703570/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 50(7)</a>\n     of the Adhiniyam, the Director has an authority to\n     revise the final scheme within a period of two years\n     and then under Section 56 of the Adhiniyam the\n     Authority has been given power to initiate\n     negotiations for acquisition a within a period of 3\n     years, failing which the land acquisition proceedings\n     may be initiated and Section 57 postulates the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                   22</span>\n\n     commencement of the development work after the\n     land is acquired and is vested in the authority. As such\n     the word &#x27;implementation&#x27; can never be construed to\n     mean that the scheme should be fulfilled or carried out\n     within a period of three years.

But if steps have been taken\n     by the authorities towards the implementation of the\n     scheme then, the word &#x27;implementation&#x27; shall not be\n     construed to mean that the period of three years is the\n     period prescribed for the completion of the scheme.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">     23.

Further, if for any reason it fails so\n\nto acquire, it may request the State Government to acquire such\n\nland under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/7832/\" id=\"a_47\">Land Acquisition Act</a> 1894. Such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                  27</span>\n\nrequest is not subject to period of limitation. Besides, even after\n\nrequest is made to the State Government, as aforesaid, under Rule\n\n20 Sub Rule 4 (b), the Authority may on an application of the\n\nowner of the land enter into agreement in Form-XX provided that\n\non the date of such agreement proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1792838/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 6</a> of the\n\nLand Acquisition Act 1894 have not been initiated by the\n\ncompetent authority.

The GDA had already proceeded to acquire the land on\n\n11.3.1991, as is evident from agreements passed on Board by the\n\nGDA and taken on record i.e. agreement dt.12.7.1989 which has\n\nbeen executed between GDA and Raghuveer Singh, agreement\n\ndt.24.7.1989 executed between GDA and Ghanshyam Singh and\n\nagreement dt.15.11.1989 executed between GDA and Grah\n\nNirman Sahkari Samiti, i.e. within 3 years of final publication of\n\ndevelopment scheme under <a href=\"/doc/703570/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 50 (7)</a> of the Adhiniyam of\n\n1973.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">17.

It is therefore, illegal\n\ncontract within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 23</a> of the Indian Contract\n\nAct.

Gupta, learned Senior counsel for respondents\n\nno.4 and 5 and Shri Raghvendra Dixit, learned counsel for the\n\nG.D.A contend that as a matter of fact the G.D.A had taken a\n\ndecision by order of the Chief Executive Officer dated 29.5.2019\n\nto resile the agreement dated 28.12.1997 in respect of 16 bigha 4\n\nbiswa out of 20 bigha 6 biswa of Survey No.388.              It is only\n\nthereafter that the agreement dated 7.6.2019 was entered into\n\nbetween Kamal Singh and G.D.A. The agreement is a registered\n\nagreement. Referring to the various clauses of the agreement,\n\nlearned senior counsel submits that as per this agreement the\n\nparties decided that G.D.A shall handover 25% of the developed\n\nplots    to respondent no.4      and in compliance thereof         the\n\nimpugned order of allotment of plots dated 3.9.2019 was passed.\n\nThe agreement so entered therefore cannot be faulted with and as\n\na consequence the impugned order Annexure P/1 is impregnable\n\nin the eyes of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">        This Court has already concluded that tripartite agreement\n\ndt.28.12.1997 was an illegal agreement, therefore, the housing\n\nsociety is held to be not entitled to seek relief in the context of the\n\nagreement by criticizing the agreement dt.07.06.2019 entered into\n\nby the GDA with Kamal Singh, owner of the disputed land, more\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                   31</span>\n\nso, in the light of the order of GDA dt.28.08.2019 affirmed by the\n\nlearned Single Judge and confirmed by this Court.

Now the fourth question is as regards the direction of the\n\nlearned Single Judge contained in para 24 referable to the housing\n\nsociety.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">      Agreement dt.28.12.1997 is vulnerable in the eyes of law as\n\nhas been found by this Court and detailed in para 18. There is no\n\ndocumentary evidence on record that the petitioner society owned\n\nthe land covered under the agreement dt.28.12.1997. There is no\n\nprovision   of   determination    and   payment    of   amount    of\n\nconsideration to any of the owners of the land covered under the\n\nagreement. No details of the owners of the respective land are also\n\nprovided. The agreement is not registered as required under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/561156/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 17</a> of the Registration Act to confer any right on tripartite.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                 32</span>\n\nThere is no resolution of the GDA empowering the CEO to enter\n\ninto the agreement with housing society under Section 56 of the\n\nAdhiniyam of 1973. Therefore, the conduct of the officers of the\n\nGDA is not free from suspicion 0and hence vulnerable in the eyes\n\nof law. Therefore, an enquiry is inevitable in the obtaining facts\n\nand circumstances against the officers responsible for entering\n\ninto the agreement dt.28.12.1997 and for fixing the liability on\n\neach of the such officials after enquiry. However, looking to the\n\nfact that once the learned Single Judge had expressed that the\n\npetition involved disputed facts of the case and same could not be\n\nadjudicated under Section 226 of the Constitution of India, there\n\nwas no occasion to make omnibus directions for registration of\n\nFIR by SPE (Lokayukt) to investigate the matter and thereafter\n\nprosecute the person found guilty, more so when none of the\n\nofficers was arrayed as respondent or afforded an opportunity\n\nbefore serious aspersion were cast upon them; when there was no\n\ncomplaint by any of the farmers/owners with whom the tripartite\n\nagreement dated 28/12/1997 was signed by the housing society\n\nand when there was no material of the nature warranting such a\n\ndirection in the obtaining facts and circumstances of the case. It\n\nneeds no mention that the constitutional power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 226</a>\n\nof the Constitution of India though is not subject to statutory\n\nrestrictions,   nevertheless,   it   is   to   be   exercised   with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                     33</span>\n\ncircumspection guided by self imposed limitation ensuring due\n\nobservance of rule of law and fair play, regard being had to the\n\nconcept of justice, equity and good conscience.
