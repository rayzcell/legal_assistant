In 1960, the father of the\n\n               appellants, Muniyappa sold the land in\n\n               dispute in favour of one Ashwathaiah who in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                             2</span>\n\n\nturn sold it to one P.

In spite of the aforesaid findings, the Land Tribunal\n\nrejected the application of the appellants simply on the\n\nground that since the tenants were claiming the land in\n\ndispute as their own, they had not established their tenancy\n\nrights. Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the Land\n\nTribunal, a writ petition was moved at the instance of the\n\nappellants before the High Court which by its order dated 5th\n\nof February, 1985 remanded the case back for fresh\n\ndisposal after setting aside the said order for reconsideration\n\nof the said application after re-assessing the entire oral and\n\ndocumentary evidence on record. This order of the High\n\nCourt was, however, not challenged either by the appellants\n\nor by the respondent.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                                              6</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">3.   After remand, the Land Tribunal again by its order\n\ndated 12th of June, 2002 rejected the application of the\n\nappellants and directed the Tehsildar to take further action,\n\ninter alia, on the grounds that :-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">                (i)        Entries in the Record of Rights\n\n                           relating to the land in dispute were\n\n                           forged ;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">                (ii)        No co-relationship existed between\n\n                           the Rent Recovery Proceeding and\n\n                           the tenancy proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">4.   Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the Land\n\nTribunal, a writ petition was filed in the High Court which\n\nwas disposed of on 6th of June, 2003 by an order in which\n\nthe learned Single Judge of the High Court had come to the\n\nconclusion that the appellants were in possession of the\n\nland in dispute.       However, it was held by the High Court\n\nthat the appellants must produce some materials to show\n\nthat the appellants had acquired tenancy rights in respect of\n\nthe land in dispute without considering the findings of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                              7</span>\n\n\nRent   Recovery    proceedings    and    admission     of   the\n\nrespondent on the question of possession and tenancy of the\n\nappellants in respect of the same. In appeal, the Division\n\nBench of the High Court also confirmed the order of the\n\nlearned Single Judge after making, inter alia, the following\n\nobservations:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;The appellants-petitioners have not been able to show that\nthey were in possession of the land and the learned Single\nJudge on consideration found that in the absence of any\nmaterial produced before the Tribunal, the petitioners cannot\ntake advantage to get the tenancy rights in their favour,\nthough they may be in possession. The learned Single Judge\nobserved that mere possession does not indicate the status\nand therefore held that the Tribunal was justified in rejecting\ntheir request as they have failed to prove their tenancy.&quot;\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">A reading of this finding of the Division Bench of the High\n\nCourt would only lead us to hold that the findings arrived at\n\non the question of possession of the appellants relating to\n\nthe land in dispute were contradictory. At one place, the\n\nDivision Bench observed that the appellants could not show\n\nthat they were in possession of the land in dispute and in\n\nanother place the Division Bench observed that they may be\n\nin possession, but such possession cannot lead the court to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                                            8</span>\n\n\nhold that the appellants had acquired tenancy rights\n\nrelating to the land in dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">5.   Feeling aggrieved by the order of the Division Bench,\n\nthe present Special Leave Petitions were filed by the\n\nappellants in this Court, which on grant of leave were heard\n\nin the presence of the learned counsel for the parties.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">6.   Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and\n\nafter going through the materials on record, the only\n\nquestion that needs to be decided in the present appeals is\n\nwhether the land in dispute was tenanted on 1st of March,\n\n1974, i.e. the day on which the Act was amended and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/115018119/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 44</a>, <a href=\"/doc/170613133/\" id=\"a_6\">45</a> and <a href=\"/doc/16557612/\" id=\"a_7\">48A</a> of the Act were introduced. As\n\nnoted herein earlier, the appellants had brought on record\n\nthe following documents and evidence to substantiate their\n\ncase of tenancy in respect of the land in dispute on the\n\nnotified date :-\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">                   (i)   Admission      of   the     landlord-\n\n                         respondent made in the year 1960-\n\n                         1962.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                             9</span>\n\n\n                (ii)     Judgment and order dated 29th of\n\n                         June,   1972    in    Rent   Recovery\n\n                         proceedings for the period from\n\n                         1966 to 1972.\n\n                (iii)    Entries in the revenue Record of\n\n                         Rights relating to land in dispute\n\n                         from 1969 to 1997.\n\n                (iv)     Evidence of independent witnesses\n\n                         of adjoining areas;\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">7.   It may be mentioned herein that against the aforesaid\n\ndocuments and evidence produced by the appellants in\n\norder to prove their possession and right of tenancy relating\n\nto the land in dispute, the respondent, however, had failed\n\nto produce any document to establish that he was in\n\npossession of the land in dispute on the relevant date i.e. on\n\n1st of March, 1974.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">8.   From a bare perusal of the orders passed by the Land\n\nTribunal and the learned Single Judge as well as the\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court, it is clear that the\n\nappellants were found to be in possession and in cultivation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                             10</span>\n\n\nof the land in dispute. The only ground on which the claim\n\nof tenancy right of the appellants was not accepted either by\n\nthe Land Tribunal or by the High Court was that the\n\nappellants had failed to produce any document or material\n\nto show that they had acquired tenancy rights in respect of\n\nthe land in dispute on the appointed day. In view of our\n\nfindings made herein above that the appellants had\n\nproduced sufficient material to prove that they had acquired\n\nthe tenancy right in respect of the land in dispute, viz., the\n\nadmission of the landlord respondent in the rent recovery\n\nproceedings that -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">             (i)     The   appellants    were   tenants   and,\n\n                     therefore, were liable to pay rent to the\n\n                     respondent in respect of the land in\n\n                     dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">             (ii)    The entries in the record of rights in\n\n                     respect of the land in dispute would\n\n                     also show that the type of cultivation\n\n                     was gutha (rent).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                             11</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">                (iii)   The adjacent landowners in their\n\n                        deposition also deposed that the\n\n                        appellants were in possession and\n\n                        were in cultivation of the land in\n\n                        dispute on a lease basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">                (iv)    The names of the appellants in\n\n                        respect of the land in dispute were\n\n                        recorded in the record of rights as\n\n                        cultivators on lease basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">9.   Appearing on behalf of the appellants, Ms. Indu\n\nMalhotra, learned senior counsel, at the first instance,\n\ncontended that while deciding the issue raised before the\n\nHigh Court as well as the Land Tribunal, the entries in the\n\nrelevant Record of Rights relating to the land in dispute and\n\nalso the above aspects of the matter were not at all\n\nconsidered. Relying on a judgment of this Court in the case\n\nof Siddawwa Kom Udochappa Vaddar &amp; Anr. Vs.\n\nNingayya Erayya Hiremath &amp; Ors. [1999 (1) SCC 176],\n\nMs. Indu Malhotra, learned senior counsel contended that\n\nin view of the findings of fact arrived at by the Land Tribunal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                                             12</span>\n\n\nas well as by the High Court that on 1st of March, 1974 and\n\nthereafter, the appellants continued to be in possession of\n\nthe land in dispute and in cultivation of the said land and\n\ntherefore, they were necessarily entitled to registration as an\n\noccupancy right holder.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">10.   The learned counsel appearing for the respondent\n\ncontested the aforesaid submission of the learned senior\n\ncounsel appearing for the appellants and sought to argue\n\nthat the appellants had miserably failed to prove that they\n\nwere tenants under the deceased Rama Reddy or his\n\npredecessor-in-interest and in view of the fact that the two\n\ncourts concurrently found that although the appellants were\n\nin possession of the land in dispute had failed to prove their\n\nstatus in respect of the land in dispute, would not be\n\nentitled to any relief.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">11.   Having examined the aforesaid submissions of the\n\nlearned counsel for the parties and after going through the\n\nimpugned order and the materials on record, we are of the\n\nview that the judgment of the High Court is liable to be set\n\naside for the reasons mentioned hereinafter. Taking into\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                                                13</span>\n\n\nconsideration the findings of fact on the question of\n\npossession arrived at by the High Court as well as the Land\n\nTribunal that the appellants were in possession and in\n\ncultivation of the land in dispute and considering the\n\nadmission made by the landlord/respondent that the\n\nappellants were tenants in respect of the land in dispute in\n\nearlier recovery proceedings relating to arrears of rent and\n\nconsidering the fact that on the relevant date of coming into\n\nforce of the Act, viz., on 1st of March, 1974, the appellants\n\nwere in possession of the land in dispute, we have no\n\nhesitation to hold that the continuous possession of the\n\nappellants which was conclusively found by the Tribunal as\n\nwell as by the High Court and in view of the admitted fact\n\nthat the respondent had admitted in their deposition of an\n\nearlier proceeding that the appellants were tenants in\n\nrespect of the land in dispute and the entries in the Record\n\nof   Rights   clearly   show   that   the   appellants   were   in\n\npossession of the land in dispute and the nature of\n\ncultivation was gutha and further in the absence of any\n\nmaterial produced by the respondent to show that in fact\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                                                14</span>\n\n\nthe appellants were not tenants in respect of the land in\n\ndispute, we are of the view that there is no escape that the\n\nappellants had acquired occupancy right in respect of the\n\nland in dispute and their names shall be registered as\n\noccupancy right holders in respect of the land in dispute. In\n\nSiddawwa Kom Udochappa Vaddar (Supra), this Court,\n\nwhile dealing with a case under the Act, observed as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">&quot;The short question which falls for consideration is that on the\nrelevant date, that is on 1.3.1974, when the Act came into\nforce, as to who has been in possession of the land.

In our view, this decision on the face of it cannot be\n\napplied in the facts and circumstances of the present case\n\nbecause the aforesaid decision was rendered in a case which\n\nwas covered under the <a href=\"/doc/117675938/\" id=\"a_9\">Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural\n\nLands Act, 1948</a>. Furthermore, in the aforesaid decision, the\n\nconcurrent findings on the question of possession was not\n\nin favour of the person who was claiming to get his name\n\nregistered as an occupancy right holder in respect of the\n\nland in dispute, whereas in the present case, the concurrent\n\nfindings of fact on the question of possession by the High\n\nCourt as well as by the Land Tribunal stood in favour of the\n\nappellants. At the risk of repetition, in the present case both\n\nthe Land Tribunal and the High Court held that the\n\nappellants were in possession of the land in dispute and the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f                                                            16</span>\n\n\nentries in the Record of Rights also stood in their names\n\nshowing that the nature of cultivation was gutha (rent) and\n\nalso the appellants were in possession of the same. As noted\n\nherein earlier, the respondent had failed to produce any\n\ndocument or material to show to the contrary.      Therefore,\n\nthe onus was on the respondent to show by producing\n\nmaterial that the appellants had not acquired any status of\n\noccupancy right although they were found to be in\n\ncontinuous possession of the land in dispute.          (See :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1611048\" id=\"span_17\"><a href=\"/doc/1611048/\" id=\"a_10\">Gajadhar Prosad Singh &amp; Ors. vs. Sheo Nandan Prosad\n\nSingh &amp; Ors.</a> [ 23 CWN 304]. Since the respondent had\n\nfailed to produce any material or document to prove that the\n\nappellants had not acquired any status in respect of the\n\nland in dispute and had failed to show that the entries in\n\nthe Record of Rights were wrong, we do not find any ground\n\nto reject the claim of the appellants for conferring status of\n\noccupancy right holder in respect of the land in dispute.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"7149\" id=\"span_18\">In\n\nview of our discussions made hereinabove, we do not find\n\nany support to rely on the decision of this Court in the case\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/7149/\" id=\"a_11\">Jattu Ram Vs.

It is true that the entries in the\n\nrevenue record cannot create any title in respect of the land\n\nin dispute, but it certainly reflects as to who was in\n\npossession of the land in dispute on the date the name of\n\nthat person had been entered in the revenue record. That\n\napart, in that decision of this Court, on which reliance was\n\nplaced by the learned Counsel for the respondent, it was\n\nadmitted that the landlord did not receive any rent from the\n\nperson in possession. Relying on this admission of the\n\nperson from whom no rent was received, it was found that\n\nthe plea of tenancy was a false one. As noted herein earlier,\n\nin the present case, not only the revenue records clearly\n\nshow that the appellants were in continuous possession of\n\nthe land in dispute, and the admission of the respondent\n\nthat the appellants were tenants in an earlier recovery\n\nproceedings, and in the absence of any document having\n\nbeen produced by the respondent to show that the entries in\n\nthe Record of Rights were wrong, it is not possible for us to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                                            18</span>\n\n\nrely on the aforesaid decision cited by the learned counsel\n\nfor the respondent.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"258883\" id=\"span_21\">So far as the decision of a learned Judge\n\nof the Bombay High Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/258883/\" id=\"a_12\">Rita Premchand &amp;\n\nAnr.

This\n\nproposition is not disputed, nor can we dispute it. In view of\n\nour discussions made hereinabove and accepting the\n\nprinciples enunciated in the aforesaid decision of the\n\nBombay High Court we are of the view that the name of the\n\nappellants should be registered as an occupancy right\n\nholder in respect of the land in dispute.
